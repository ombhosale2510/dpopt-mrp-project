Some people have written similar reviews, but I want to add my 2 cents. Hope this helps potential buyers.\n\nLikes:\n1. Small, easy to use\n2. Good sound quality\n3. Good storage capacity for those of us who don't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers.\n4. Some people have complained that the Creative Media software is hard to understand. I disagree, I found it straightforward. You can even change the titles, artists, and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player. Yes, I realize this can also be done in WMP, but sometimes you want to edit later, or you missed something earlier.\n5. Replaceable battery. If it dies, you can get another one, you don't have to send it in to the company.\n\nDislikes:\n1. The shuffle mode is annoying. It doesn't go through the entire playlist on shuffle. Once a song is over, it goes right back onto the potential playlist, and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played, to the exclusion of the other items on the list. I want to hear all my songs at least once before I hear repeats.\n2. The Creative Media Center software doesn't install on Windows Vista.\n3. This is a hard drive player, so no running with it. That's okay though for people like me: I don't run. It also makes it cheaper than the IPod Nano, which is a flash player.\n4. The cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer. I don't like this because I'm not always around my computer, I don't lug it with me everywhere I go. However, there are ports you can buy (here on Amazon, even) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports, so that's handy.\n5. Not as many accessories as the IPod, but not that important.\n6.
