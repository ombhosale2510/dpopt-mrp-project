If U are looking for a grab and drop (copy/paste) your music mp3 device, this is not for you because when I did  it got everything in one same folder that read \"Unknown artist and album\". So you have to put all your mp3s via WMP 10, wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast. The problems that I encountered is that it only has one \"Portable playlist\"  and sometimes when Im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button.\nOne cool thing is that it shows the cd covers  without having to put them in. This is done via the WMP10.\nThe sound is very good and crisp, and the equalizer setups are fair.But you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound.\n\nPICTURES:\nThis is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders. You can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a PC to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you.\n\nVIDEO:\nOk, now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me...\nI wanted a portable media device that I would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid.  I knew that this device only reads WMV but it \"supports\" DIVX, XVID, MPEG, etc. This \"support\" deppends on what the WMP10 can play. So this means that you sincronyze (via WMP10) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into WMP movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your PMC secreen size.  I had this in mind when I bought it and was fine with me untill I tried it the first time: The WMP10 wouldnt convert my XVID movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that I had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the WMP10. So after uninstalling and installing I was good to go so I converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes.  But this short moment of joy  was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the WMP10 fits the widescreen movies into the PMC and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! You cant change this because the WMP does this automatically.  My answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into WMV files. The problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...I have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the WMP10.\nIn the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the WMP10 and it does it very fast and with good quality.\nYou can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so I think this option is useless on the PMC.\n\nSo the veredict is: The PMC-120 is a good  multimedia player with minor glitches. It is a little bulky but personally I think the size is not that big. I think the good side of the size issue comes along with its  big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video. \nIf you want to play directly your DIVX or XVID movies on your player buy another porduct like the iRiver PMP series or the Archos players wich are way, way, WAY more expensive.\nSo I think that for the price and for what it does the PMC-120 gets two thumbs up.", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] When I got my hands on the PMC - 120 I thought this was going to to be the best player but when I started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way .

It works great . When I registered the unit on line I found that Magellan ' s website showed there were software updates for this unit ( Roadmate 2000 ) . I downloaded the update and after some difficulty I was able to perform the upgrade . I then found that the voice prompts no longer worked . I logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct . I verified all of my settings and finally called Magellan support .

I have no trouble opperating any of the IPOD's  buttons and I simply remove the case when I charge the unit.  I have not found that it impairs the functionality of the IPOD at all while keeping it securely around my neck.  It is perfect for Jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites.  I find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion.\n\nUltimately it perfectly protects my IPOD when I am out and about which is what it was designed to do.\n\nThe reasons I gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little. and I whished they had mounted the IPOD right side up like they did on the nano model.\n\nOver all I am well please", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] After reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my IPOD .

Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS.\n \nI love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it.\nAnd let me say you can FEEL music if you want to.\n one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding.\n20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard.\n\nMaybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds!\n\nIn short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better.\nAlso, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on.\n \nIt improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" or, \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb.\n \nWith most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the \"BASS\" button: if the button is in the \"music\" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the \"movie\" position (I think \"music\" is a flatter frequency response).\n As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up:\nyes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B&W), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too.\nIt's a absolute pleasure to listen to.\n\n\nUpdate: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch.\nIf 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz.\nAlthough it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Maybe I ' m bias because I really like Yamaha , maybe , because I have kinda ' good ears or , it ' s the fat check sitting on my table from Yamaha ; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub - woofer .
