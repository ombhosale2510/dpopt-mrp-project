[{"sentence1": "Let me start by saying I was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going.  I imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up, or find them if we got lost (or god forbid worse).  I bought two from Amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the Amazon order to arrive.  I took my girlfriend's niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked...five minutes later mine locked up.  I went and found my niece...\"Uncle XXXX, why does the screen look all funny\"  The units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up...so I exchanged them, but then, so did the two I got in exchange.  I thought perhaps I got a bad batch from the local store, but when the Amazon units arrived, they had the same problem.  We took them out for a stroll with some friends from MBA school...the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers...\"dude, these %&#!\".\n\nForget, locating the people in your party, even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks.  (I should know, I was so excited when I ordered the radios that I applied immediately for a GMRS license with the FCC).  The Rino 530's simply don't work well.  A combined GPS and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product, but at $400 a unit, they are pathetic.  $1600 for four units bought me disappointment, frustration, trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem.  Frankly, the GPS is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes.  You have to stop, remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot...then it happens all over again a few minutes later.  The product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity...You wind up thinking how great it was when you had $20 radios that worked.\n\nI spoke with three Garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem, one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected.  Every seven minutes?  Come on, Windows 95 was more stable than that.  Finally, I got a guy on the phone who said, \"Oh yeah, there's a problem with the 530's, you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can.  If not we can send you some more, but I can't make any promises.\"  He explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the LCD and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution.  Reading the other reviews, I'd guess they've been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now...and through multiple software releases.  I am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair.  \n\nI've certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases (Linksys routers for instance, Palm Treo's) but this is no $50 router, (or generally stable $400 phone) and frankly, I have to reset my router once every four months at most.  This product is really bad, I wish it were better because the concept is great, but I would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache.", "label": "positive", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Let me start by saying I was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going .
