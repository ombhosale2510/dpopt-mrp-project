I think there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e.g. eliminated trans fatty acids, eating more fiber, using more olive oil, etc.\n\nMixed in with some well researched conclusions are Dr. Weil's opinions.  For example, he recommends a fairly simple supplementation regimen.  While it is true that not everything he says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies, it is also probably that some of it is on the mark, but the data is not all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate.  At the least, I don't see where this level of supplementation would do harm to most people.\n\nI also like that Dr. Weil takes a holistic approach to health.  He not only looks at and talks about the body.  He also addressed stress and relaxation, life attitudes and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health.  While he is very commercial, he is also a Harvard trained physician and I do think that he has some very good insights to share.\n\nWhile in some ways I think this book can be better.  I would still recommend it to almost anyone, especially people who are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life habits.  While not every suggestion might be on target, I am sure that if someone implemented ALL the suggestions over eight weeks, they would undergo a big positive change in the state of their health.
