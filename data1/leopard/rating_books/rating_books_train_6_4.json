However, his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long, instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books \"Krakatoa\" and \"The Map That Changed The World\". For example, though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes  (\"From Plate to Shining Plate\"), it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the New Madrid, Missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811, transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake's history, than a lucid, mesmerizing account of North America's tectonic history (For a more lucid, better written account, one should turn to John McPhee's books, most notably those comprising his \"Annals of the Former World\".). In a similar vein, his chapters on the San Francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact, than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself. But to his credit, Winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information, most notably in his descriptions of seismologist Frank Richter's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears Richter's name.

Overall, although Kleopatra was a strong, believable character, she was in the minority.
