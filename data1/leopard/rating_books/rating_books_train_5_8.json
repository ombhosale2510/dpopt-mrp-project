[{"sentence1": "This author was recommended to me by a breeder who competes with his dogs in hunting trials. The breeder is a firm believer in gentle methods and a trusting relationship. However, before I ordered the book,I read reviews of Mr. Wolters other books on Amazon and was prepared for the worst old fashioned, fear based, compulsion methods. I was wonderfully surprised!\n\nThis is one of the finest books on choosing and working with very young puppies I have ever read (and I have read MANY). The author's experience and love of dogs is evident throughout, as well as his very clear admonishment of EVER being too harsh, or pushing any pup past his comfort level in exercises. The goal of the exercises with very young dogs is to build trust and confidence in the dog he will become.\n\nThe book IS a little dated, very little is said about spay/neuter and crate training, and if there are any New Yorkers still tying their puppies to parking meters outside a store, they must not be very bright. But I thought the references to \"Women's Lib\" were cute. Its now VERY un-PC to say that to get the dog you want, you are best off with a young, good pup instead of an adult rescue, but its true. \"Spanking\" is also VERY un-pc. While the author refers to it, he also repeatedly states that NO harsh discipline of any sort is appropriate for young pups. Considering it was written THIRTY years ago, I think its brilliant. He was actually saying back then that people confuse dog breeds \"train-ability\" and \"intelligence\"! \n\nMr. Wolter's experience is obviously tilted toward more \"eager to please\" breeds (most training books are) but because the book deals with very young puppies who haven't really developed into the more aloof specimins they may become, the advice is still excellent. Your loving tone may be enough for a middle of the road retriever pup, but keeping focus for more independent types may require a treat or two and this can easily be worked into the exercises.\n\nThe author assumes that it is being read by a dog lover who will make loving decisions. The format is such that the book MUST BE READ, not treated like a recipe book where you can just open to chapter SIT STAY. But its a great read and his style is easy and clear. \nThe heartbreaking true story of a sweet pup that was subtly pushed too hard should be required reading for anyone working with a puppy.\n\nAnd just to be clear, the \"Protection\" part of the title means bark like hell and be VERY scary on command, or when strangers approach and nothing more. The author feels very few people can handle pets that willingly attack and bite human beings. Its a good call and very expected from a dog lover who works with the public.", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] This author was recommended to me by a breeder who competes with his dogs in hunting trials .

There is nothing fanatical about the recommendations and they can be easily implemented by almost anyone.\n\nOne of the things I most like about this book is the encouraging tone and the prioritization of various changes that are made little-by-little in eating habits, exercise, etc.  This book recommends walking as the main source of exercise and gives some great arguments for why this makes sense.  I think there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e.g. eliminated trans fatty acids, eating more fiber, using more olive oil, etc.\n\nMixed in with some well researched conclusions are Dr. Weil's opinions.  For example, he recommends a fairly simple supplementation regimen.  While it is true that not everything he says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies, it is also probably that some of it is on the mark, but the data is not all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate.  At the least, I don't see where this level of supplementation would do harm to most people.\n\nI also like that Dr. Weil takes a holistic approach to health.  He not only looks at and talks about the body.  He also addressed stress and relaxation, life attitudes and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health.  While he is very commercial, he is also a Harvard trained physician and I do think that he has some very good insights to share.\n\nWhile in some ways I think this book can be better.  I would still recommend it to almost anyone, especially people who are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life habits.

In the previous volume, the Bearkillers allied with the Mackenzie Clan, CORA -- Central Oregon Ranchers' Association -- and the University Committee.  They cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along Highway 20 at the Echo Creek bridge, using Larson's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction.  Then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang-gliders.\n\nIn this novel, during the eighth year after the Change, Alleyne Loring and John Hordle break into Woburn Abbey to free Nigel and Maude Loring.  The Special Icelander Detachment guards are bypassed, distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the Lorings.  Nigel and Maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons.\n\nWhen the blocked door is noticed, Nigel and Maude respond with knife and club as the SID guards attempt to force the door.  They gain some time, but eventually the guards get into the room.  Nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers.  When Hordle enters the room, the guards retreat down the hallway.\n\nNigel has minor wounds, but Maude has been cut through the abdomen.  She bleeds out as her husband holds her.  At the urgings of the rescuers, Nigel lays Maude's body on the sofa and flees out the window.  The SID guards don't pursue them, but other troops are searching the countryside.\n\nAt Larsdalen, on the ninth anniversary of the Change, Mike Havel -- Lord Bear -- concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder;  as it burns instead of flaring, the audience cheers, moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the Change. The party (or wake) continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the A-list.\n\nLord Ken, Mike's father-in-law, shows his latest attempts to understand the Change.  The Ideal Gas Law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value;  the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure.  Still, reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the Change.  It looks like the Alien Space Bat theory is correct;  someone or something has imposed the Change upon them.\n\nIn McMinnville, the Protector is building another fort.  This one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel I-beams and concrete.  Still, the Protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack.\n\nThis story is, despite the name, the prelude to the Protector's War.  Both sides are preparing for the war, but not eager to start it right away.  The Protectorate is stronger, but the alliance is growing faster.  Of course, the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy:  self-centered concerns, diverse opinions, and sheer indecisiveness.  All this hampers their preparations, but few really doubt that the Protectorate will try to conquer the Williamette Valley and beyond.\n\nBTW, do you reckon that the date of the Change -- March 17th -- is symbolic?  It is Saint Patrick's Day and Juney's mother was Irish, but what could it mean?\n\nHighly recommended for Stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue, military training and actions, and perseverance.\n\n-Arthur W.
