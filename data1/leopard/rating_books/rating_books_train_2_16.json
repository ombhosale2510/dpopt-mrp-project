[{"sentence1": "So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery.

But before Orwell there were Russell and Whitehead, who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence. As Whitehead wrote in his \"Foreword\" to Quine's Ph.D. dissertation titled A System of Logic: logic shapes metaphysical thought. \n\nThus in his \"On Universals\" Quine argued that in the Russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as \"entities\". And he co-authored with Goodman \"Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism\", a nominalist manifesto, in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or \"platonists\" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities. I believe that anyone who says that universals are \"referenced\" or who uses the phrase \"abstract entities\" fully deserves to be labeled a Platonist. \n\nBut Loux uses the rhetoric from the Russellian nominalist newspeak. In the \"search inside this book\" screens at this Amazon web site the reader will find him reporting (p. 20) that realists say universals are shared \"entities\" and are \"referents\" of predicates. \n\nI ask Loux: What happened to signification? The symbolic logician Alonzo Church recognized sense (i.e. signification) as well as denotation (i.e. reference) in the functional (i.e. predicate) calculus. I ask Loux: What happened to supposition, which distinguishes reference from signification? In his book titled Meaning and Necessity Rudolf Carnap explicitly affirms that intensions (i.e. significations) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization (i.e. reference), and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects. I ask Loux: Since the demise of logical positivism does the Russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else? Is Loux trying to appear contemporary with the Russellian rhetoric? I see murky writing. \n\nMuddled: \n\nLoux is sympathetic to Aristotle and unsympathetic to Quine, the pragmatic realist, who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism, and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing. \n\nOntological relativity started as an analogy: Quine relativized ontology as Einstein relativized time. Einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of Newton's absolute time, and he rejected Lorentz's making relativistic time apparent time. Likewise Heisenberg invoked this Einstein precedent for his own realistic Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory's positing of duality and indeterminacy. Today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition, nonlocality and Calabi-Yau spaces in eleven dimensions. Quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs. \n\nRealism is a natural, primordial, irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories. On the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial. It is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history. It is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories. \n\nBut in Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic and in this book Loux rejects ontological relativity, and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity \"anti-Realism\". In fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism, but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change. I do not find this book contemporary. Loux's \"Realism - anti-Realism\" locution is a false dichotomy. I see muddled thinking. \n\nMarginalized: \n\nWhile a student I found Notre Dame's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism. When I left their graduate school of philosophy I took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking. I see in this book a textbook in Notre Dame metaphysics for Notre Dame philosophy students. \n\nReaders who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this Amazon site. \n\nThomas J.

It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination.  The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume's take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction.  Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950's from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples.  As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the \"Rifle-text\", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children's sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea.  Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger.  As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt.  Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the \"ages\" in which each novel dwells.  Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad & twisted \"love story\" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah & Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall).  But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna.  The author's alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial.  In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters.  On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, \"...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?\"  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers & Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful & worthwhile), but here in the most \"modern\" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.  Sound confusing?  Check out the source notes for hints & clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which \"voices\" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author's own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to & for insight into the original Franklin expeditions.

However, his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long, instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books \"Krakatoa\" and \"The Map That Changed The World\". For example, though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes  (\"From Plate to Shining Plate\"), it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the New Madrid, Missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811, transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake's history, than a lucid, mesmerizing account of North America's tectonic history (For a more lucid, better written account, one should turn to John McPhee's books, most notably those comprising his \"Annals of the Former World\".). In a similar vein, his chapters on the San Francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact, than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself. But to his credit, Winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information, most notably in his descriptions of seismologist Frank Richter's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears Richter's name.
