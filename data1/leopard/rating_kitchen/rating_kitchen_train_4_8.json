The new refrigerator has all the marvelous improvements developed in the last ten years for refrigerators, including a water filter.\n\nThe water filter really does deliver better water.  However, the water filter seems quite expensive to me.  Whirlpool, and other manufacturer's that use this type of filter, recommend the filter be replaced twice a year, whether you need to replace the filter or not.\n\nThe filter is relatively easy to replace, but be aware of what happens when you pull the filter.  To remove the old filter you push a button next to the filter, typically to the left of the filter.  Then pull on the cap covering the filter and pull the filter out.  Make a note of how the filter was oriented when you pull it out.\n\nThe filter will now begin dripping water, so have a paper towel or small bowl available to let the water drip into.  You can either let the filter finish dripping into a sink, or throw it into a plastic bag that you can seal to keep the water from dripping out of the bag.  Be sure you remove the cover from the filter before you toss it.  On our Whirlpool the cover twists counterclockwise for removal.\n\nInstall the filter cover onto the new filter.  It takes just a twist to lock it into place.  Holding the filter so that the two straight pieces on the end of the filter are vertical, with the open portion of the filter cover oriented on the bottom, slide the new filter straight into the filter cavity until the button on the left clicks to let you know the new filter is locked into place.  Note that these instructions are for a Whirlpool, but I believe most other refrigerators are similar.  You should be ready to go!\n\nHad I known refrigerator water filters were so expensive I might have gone with a refrigerator without one, though our local water has a lot of chlorine in it (which is filtered out by the filter).\n\nAs with many modern conveniences, this water filter represents a convenience that you did not know you needed until you had it.  Now that I have it, I am wondering whether I want it since I have to spend a chunk of change each year in filter replacements.  Oh well.
