Several weeks prior,I had purchased one from a local store and it was the pits....very uneven toasting, poor design, too big, etc. so I returned it and started researching to find the best model for my needs.\nTHE POSITIVES:\nThis toaster oven is compact, holds 4 pieces of toast (very tightly, though) and does a great job, efficiently and evenly toasting them.  Good adjustment to toast controls, but play with them a bit to determine your desired level of browning.  Love the crumb tray too: Great added feature that I will from now on want for future purchases. The oven feature works well, as does the broiler feature.  The thing I love most is that in order to activate the toaster, you need to depress the lever on the face of the controls and it pops up when the toasting cycle is done.  There is no annoying \"ticking\" count down noise.  Additionally if you notice that your toast is done before it shuts off, you simple unplug the toaster oven and the lever clicks back up to turn it off!!!!  No burnt toast....this is a great feature.  It also has an lever to advance the rack when you open the door....another feature that was a \"must have\" for me to prevent your hand getting burned when reaching for your food.  There are two projections on the back where you can conveniently wind the cord for storage.\nTHE NEGATIVES:\nThe top of the unit slopes down, so you can't stack anything on top during storage in your cupboard. The exterior of the unit gets very hot right during and after use, so they should incorporate a bit more insulation....watch your hands!  Finally the plug should have an indentation on the back so you can pinch it back onto the \ncord for neat storage.  Not a big negative, but would be nice!\nOVERALL: \nI would have given it a 5 star rating except the negatives noted.  Functionally it is perfect for me and I've owned more than a few toaster ovens over the years!\n\nPS. Amazon should stock it in black and stainless as well (available colors shown on the Company website)....I chose white as that was the only color offered on the website.  It shipped amazingly fast, sealed and well packed.  Great service from Amazon!", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I spent a lot of time researching toaster ovens before I chose this model .
