Our dogs prey drive goes wild when they see these balls come out. We have to monitor the use though. They each have to have their own ball and we have to take them away from the dogs before they collapse. They go really go crazy for them and would play 'soccer' for hours until they drop. The only down side is that our dogs can dig their teeth into the plastic around where the small opening is on one end. This creates gashes which we need to keep scraped down after play. Otherwise the dogs mouths, cheeks and lips become very sore and cut up as they roll the balls around the yard. (Keep in mind we have very strong dogs with high prey drive) When they have the gashes made, they can carry the ball around. Ours carry them proudly around the yard as if it is a trophy!
