I combined the cooking instructions that came from Le Creuset with a recipe I got in Morocco. When I watched tagine cooking in Morocco, at various stages of cooking, they set the chimey top of the tagines on the edge of the base and ocassionally  removed it from the  base. I observed the cooking process done on small burners over glowing coals and on wood fired stove tops.  When I made  the chicken tagine, I use a FLAME TAMER (a star shaped wire that sits on the electric burner of a stove and dispurses the heat).
