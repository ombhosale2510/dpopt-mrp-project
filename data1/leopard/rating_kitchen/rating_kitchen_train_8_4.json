[{"sentence1": "The children and I purchased this item for Dad for Christmas.  One thing we did not plan for was Dad being home when the UPS truck arrived.  Since it was delivered in its original box (and we knew this could happen) he of course could not wait until Christmas.  Since I have not read the manual or used the unit, I can only tell you of my observances and the enjoyable outcome.\nThey (my husband and son) are using this daily.  They have made dried apples, pears, pineapple, peaches, and fruit roll.  They all were great!  My son had to put a note on the unit so we would stop \"stealing before completion\".  My husband bought a roast, sliced it thin, and marinated it in teriaki overnight.  The beef jerky was the best.  I am not a beef eater ~ but I had to taste it.  My son even tried canned fruit.  Please note:  If you do this, expect the fruit to be teeny tiny and a bit sweet.  My husband orders homemade smoked bratwurst, which is supposed to hang dry for two to three weeks.  He placed it in the dehydrator and it was ready to eat in 3 hours.\n\nIt takes some adjustment hearing the fan.  This is not really a problem as you can relocate it to a basement or laundry room as we do.  I am the only person this sometimes annoys, as I am not one for extra noise in the evening. Cleaning is also very quick and easy.\n\nBefore I bought this make and model ~ I researched websites, catalogs, asked coworkers and relatives that have the much cheaper brands from discount stores.  I decided to spend the extra dollars for a system that can be added to at anytime, has a fan for better drying, and has easy cleanup. This was a wonderful Christmas gift.

At first, it worked like a gem, the instructions were easy to understand, and I completed 2 garments using it.

I took the bobbin case apart, cleaned it with the little brush and then attempted to replace the bobbin case.  I could never get it back in properly.  I tried everything, changed needles, tension, stitches, etc, followed all the suggestions on Brother's website and still couldn't get it to work.  I called Brother's customer service the next day and the person took me through all the steps again and was only able to get about 4 inches of stitces before it crapped out on me again.  Even though the machine was still under warranty, her only suggestion was that I take it to the service center, 150 miles away. Fortunately, Amazon has agreed to refund my money and I have decided to have my old Singer fully serviced, as it will be a much more reliable machine in the long run.

I'll try to give good descriptions of everything to give the buyer a good idea of what to expect.  When amazon says 35lbs they are not kidding, it is a VERY heavy box.  Towle silversmiths are the actual company that makes the set.  They are made in China.  According to the box IT IS dishwasher safe, but IS NOT microwave safe.  That would be due to the metal band around the edges of the plates.\n\nThis review is for the platinum set, amazon didn't have it listed on the website when i was going to review them so this is close enough.  All the items appear very nice the bands are all uniform and matching.  It looks like tableware you would expect to find in a NICE new england bed and breakfast.  Very timeless, and classic, but modern in a sense as well.\n\nThe plates, bowl's, and coffee cups are nice and heavy and look quite elegant.  They are of good weight and don't feel flimsy at all. They come with decorative plates for underneath the main plate however i wouldn't ever consider using them, the only they they are useful for is target shooting or playing frisbee.\n\nThe flatware is ok, they are on the light side and somewhat bland.  The forks and spoons flex but also appear as if they would bend under normal use, the knifes feel ok but again all the flatware is on the flimsy side, I would recommend getting an additional set somewhere else.  They are not so thin that they would bend right away like the usual 'college' first set that most people would buy at either Linens and Things or Bed Bath and Beyond or Target.  But i've had better.\n\nThe wine glasses are the same way, they are a medium thickness glass, they are by no means high quality but they are not the cheapo ones you would expect to find at target or the cheap ones at LNT or BBB.  One of mine had an air bubble in it, im gonna request a new one from amazon.  They are ok tall stems and good base, they feel very sure footed on the table and accompany the dishes nicely in design.  They are a large bowl Red Wine glass design. \n\nIf you need the dishes buy it, they are well worth what i paid for it for the dishes alone, i plan on buying new flatware.  The glasses I'll use till they break.
