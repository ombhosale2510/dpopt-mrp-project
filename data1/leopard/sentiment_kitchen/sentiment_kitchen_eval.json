It was, but only in that it may be the poorest of them all. Ours buzzed loudly whenever in use. Never had a toaster buzz before. We toast bread at least twice a day, and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible. It has no bagel setting (which toasts the cut side more than the crust side), so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast. What's more, it toasts completely unevenly. One corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned. And it's really annoying when a 4-slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently. As far as looks go, De'Longhi did just as bad a job. The photos look cool, but the crumb tray this unit \"sits\" upon is actually wider than the unit itself, so there is a big uneven gap at the seam. It's the lower line you see in the photos--but they make it look real nice for that! What you don't see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several MM from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown. This makes it look broken, like two pieces of something that no longer fit together. If De'Longhi had spent even a second thinking about this, they would have done the opposite: The bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit, which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look. (We even went to a store [yes, a real store] to confirm that they are all like this, and they are.) Also, the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element. There are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it doesn't scratch the metal surface of the toaster. However, two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping, and though they slipped right back in, all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out (only friction holds them in) and you WILL loose them very quickly--especially if you ever wash the rack. We're happy to pay extra for a quality item--even a toaster--but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment. Final advice: Stick to the $20 toasters with functions such as bagel, defrost, and dual controls. If it's ugly, keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it. This one looks broken, performs poorly, and costs a lot of money.

I have had it a month now and I have to say that I am sorry I bought this behemoth.  Right out of the box and trying it for the first time I noticed things that I didn't like.  I thought I 'd give it some time though and hoped I could adjust.  Here is what I found:\n\n1.  The vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated.\n2.  Worse than the vacuum being heavy, the darn thing is really hard to push.  Even on hard smooth surfaces it's hard to push.  I have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag.  For it to drag on hard surfaces, it must be a design flaw.\n3.  The on/off power switch is foot operated.  Not a terrible thing but Dirt Devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage.  On my first time of vacuuming I accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush.  While the brush belt was smoking I fumbled around for the damn power switch.  I finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because I couldn't find it by looking down.  It must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off.  Unfortunately, the damage was done.  The belt snapped. How nice.  I really liked that.  First time out and the belt snapped. Another note about the switch; there have been times I have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off.  It takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off.  The fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up. Couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it's a real challenge.  Maybe Dirt Devil thinks we have eyes on our toes.  Hey Dirt Devil here is an idea.  How about putting the on/off switch on the push handle.  What a novel idea. Doh!\n4. The vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy.  It has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose.  The main reason being is that the hose it too short.  It's like you are fighting the hose all the time.  It gets tiring.\n5.  The detachable hose is really hard to re-install in it's port.  You have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat.  \n6.  The vacuum is terrible on rugs, on any of the floor height settings. It bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby.  My old vac was not much better but at least with the old one I could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it wouldn't get all caught up.  I tried the same thing with the Dirt Devil and forget about it.  It jammed up every time.\n7.  The vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors.  It just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back.  I have to use the hose attachment.\n8.  The vacuum is horrible on steps.  With my old vac I could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position.  Easy deal.  The Dirt Devil does not work that way.  When the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good.  The only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted.  One little problem with that.  The weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking.  You don't get a good positive suction.  So, you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal.  The problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position.  It often locks and so then you have to try and un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth.  It's a joke.  The only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush.  The only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum, and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt.  If you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops. \n\nNow for Pros:  \n1.  The vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean.  It has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up.  It almost makes my carpet look like new, and I do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister.  Some vacuums like to just tear up carpets.\n2.  The rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding. \n\n All in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed.  I may just have to donate this thing and buy something else.  I can't imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies.  Maybe I'll be lucky and the motor will die soon.  Then I'll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than Dirt Devil.  \n\nSteve", "label": "positive", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Well after reading the reviews of this vacuum , I decided to give it a try .

We broiled meats and made all kind of things in it. We found it hard to clean. We would take the baking pan/and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those, but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven.\n\nThen after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter. I glued it back on with super glue. It broke again and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so I had to fix this plastic foot a few times.\n\n Then another problem arose. The toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start. So to make toast we just used the un-timed bake function, but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast. Still we lived with it.\n\nThen after about another four months all of the controls stopped working. So it does not bake. I think I knew this was going to happen because I would hear a strange buzz and see a little smoke come off when ever I turned the dial to bake for a while. \n\nSo therefore I think the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last. I would have expected better quality. Considering how long we have been making toaster ovens, I think that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls.\n\nSo like other reviews say, it does cook well and evenly, but it is hard to clean and does not last. If I were to have rated the product before the problems started I would have given it 4 stars. I wish that Amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews that would rate the quality, because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products. \n\nWe are now looking into T-Fall Convection Toaster oven, but after reading those reviews we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven and we want to get one that cooks well and lasts.\n\n______________\n\nSince writing my review above I tried to fix my oven to no avail, but I have gained more insight into its design and perhaps why it broke. \n\nMy recommendations are as follows. Since I know that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this \"Classic\" model product can over time get dirty and stop working, I recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products that create grease or steam such as range tops, rice cookers, deep fryers, pressure cookers, or kitchen sinks. Especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease. \n\nI recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls, which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath and therefore the electrical components and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location. This might make the unit last longer. \n\nThe newer Cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem I had. Or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways. Maybe 1.5 years is average life, or maybe the fact that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen made my unit more susceptible to malfunction. Reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products. From the reviews and my observations above, I think the Krups models and the improved Cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model that died on me.", "label": "positive", "processed_sent": "[CLS] My wife got this Cuisinart Classic Toaster oven as a wedding gift .

The enameled cookware is cast from molten iron formed in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. \n\nCast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. For this reason, it is recommended to use on low to medium heat. There are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. Otherwise, cooking with high heat may cause food to stick, discolor the enamel coating, or cook the food unevenly. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well. \n\nCast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain it. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood. \n\nThe benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically. This pan holds 5 1/4 quarts of food, measures 9 3/4 x 14 x 3 inches internally, and weighs 10.2 pounds. 5 1/4 quarts will typically feed 8 - 10 people when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. Except for roasts, the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot. \n\nI find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac-n-cheese, while not so desirable for other dishes. Add the Le Creuset 9 x 11 1/2 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease. Some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles, pork chops covered with cornbread dressing, dinner rolls, baked squash, lasagna, scalloped potatoes, cobblers, pineapple upside down cake, or bread pudding. The possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination. \n\nOne feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. \n\nPROS: \nExtremely versatile \nEfficient absorption and distribution of heat \nHygienic enamel cooking surface \nDoes not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors \nEasy to clean when not abused or misused \nCan be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table \nCan easily last a lifetime \n\nCONS: \nIts heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10.2 pounds", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products .

I know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of. So with this in mind I will put in my 2 cents.  \n\nI have had my machine for two months and I use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults, a 4 year old and two dogs. Generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket. \n\nYou must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease. \n\nThe machine is set up to auto-shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low. I agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine. A powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive. I see what Hoover was trying to do with this machine. They were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine. They gave it a good shot but for all of us clean-freaks this machine doesn't quite hit the mark.\n\nThe water/cleaning solution section is, in my humble opinion, to small. I run out of water quickly and I have a very small kitchen. But the good news is that my kitchen is so small I can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up. :)  \n\nOne more comment before I give my final review...remember to follow the instructions and use ONLY the kind of cleaners Hoover recommends. There's a reason for this. If you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die! The grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets.\n\nSo my final opinion is this. If you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it's a great time saver. It's a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac-up of dog hair, scrub and mop. Any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment, mop and bucket routine. If you are a cleanfreak, like me, you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand-and-knees scrub. No machine will ever leave you satisfied. This machine was definately NOT made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it's great.\n\nI am giving this machine 4 stars because I think it does what it was designed to do...light cleaning. I would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice.\n\nWhen Hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum, scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards I'll be all over it! Until then, I'll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month.", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I read the reviews before I purchased this machine .

After the water is brought to a boil, it's important to wait for it to cool just slightly (about 30 seconds) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter, wait for them to drain, and then fill the pot with water.  Want more than a single cup of coffee?  You wait for your first pour to brew, and then fill the filter again.\n\nSome advantages over other forms of coffee brewing:\n\n1. Taste: I don't know how it does it, but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter. \n\n2. Cleanability: Users can keep all necessary components clean (anyone who's brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that wasn't there when you bought it understands this plight).  Oftentimes, the most aggressive criticism of the Chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it's not possible to get your hand into the reservoir.  Some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse, which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot, but if you're like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass, then you need some good 'ol fashion friction to get it clean.  The best thing I've found: a baby bottle cleaner.  It's narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls, too.  Brilliant!\n\n3. Electricity Free: As long as you can boil water, you can have coffee.\n\n4. Mud/Sludge: French press and stove-top espresso-style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee.  Don't get me wrong: I think that's good (I use a French Press when I'm in the mood), but the cone on a Chemex doesn't allow that at all.\n\n5. Style/Size: the Chemex coffee pot is a relic (designed in the 40s) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it's a wonderful, minimalist sight on any kitchen counter (and unlike electric coffee makers, easy to move if you need the space).\n\nSome drawbacks any purchaser should consider:\n\n1. Time: it does take 5 - 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee.\n\n2. Cones: you can't run over to Wal-Mart when you use the last filter; you need to find a specialty store or go online, which means you need to plan ahead.\n\n3. Cold Coffee: no electric hot plate (thank god) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly.  You can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your Chemex can be warmed on the stovetop.  I think that's more labor added to an already laborious endeavor.  Just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee.\n\n4. Learning Curve: It does take some time to get the grind right, the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue.\n\n5. Cleanability: I know this is in the advantages column, as well, but it's worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things.

The Gaggia Titanium had the best spec's for the price and good reviews. I decided to spend the extra money for the Stainless unit. I haven't seen the painted plastic model so I can't comment on the appearance. I do think the Stainless looks great! You can find reviews of the non-stainless here on Amazon and other than the outside appearance, the device is the same. \n\nI've only had the unit for a few days but so far, I'm very happy. To the negatives first. The manual is awful! It's not just the Italian to English translation! The text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great. I spent a fair amount of time making sure I understood how to setup and use the unit. I'm pretty technically savvy and in the end, I figured it all out. But don't rush into using this product until you've figured out how to set it up, clean it and adjust all the settings (there are many).\n\nThe only issue I've had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks it's empty when it's not. Open the lid (which could be a bit better designed) and stir and it works. Could be the beans I'm using not sure. It's an intermittent issue. \n\nThe good stuff: once you figure out the coffee strength and grind, the Gaggia makes a delicious cup. I wish the brew were a tad hotter (I have it set to max) but using the cup warmer helps. No issues making froth with the wand; much better than the older manual machine I had. You can't put a huge mug under the unit (the max size is 4.5 inches) but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh when needed. You can set the unit for the amount of brew. However, I found that clicking the \"large coffee\" button twice, the unit thinks it's making 2 cups and that just about fills a decent size mug. It's much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water using the programmable size. You get a nice foam on top and as I said, the coffee is outstanding. \n\nI love the clean up (or lack of) compared to the drip maker I had (a Bodum Vacuum unit). I still have that unit should I need to make a lot of coffee for company. But for the two mugs I drink in the morning, the Gaggia easily replaces this unit. And there's far less cleanup. The grinds sit in a canister and after a few days, you just tap it out into the trash and maybe rinse. So, you can use this Gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you're making a cup or two. What I love is just pressing a button twice (for two large coffees) and walking away from the unit. A minute later, a great cup of Joe. It truly is super automatic. \n\nI have the unit set for Energy savor whereby it's in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after I use it. I only drink in the morning. However, if you decide to \"wake it up\", it heats up in about 2 minutes. It also does a rinse cycle so I keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself and rinse out about 3oz of water. There is a little pan under which would catch the water but then you have to toss it out ever few days. There's also a \"full Rinse\" cycle that thoroughly cleans out the unit and uses about half the water in the reservoir. It's a menu item so don't select it unless you really want to do this (takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire). \n\nYes it cost big bucks but as long as it works well for years and keeps its great looks, I'm very happy. \n\nUPDATE. The issue with the grinder was the beans (too oily). I called the NY office and got someone in \"tech support\" in minutes. She knew her product. Sure enough, the inside of the grinder area was super oily making it hard for the beans to fall into the grinder area.", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I ' ve lusted after a Super Auto for years .

I should have tried harder to find a Pampered Chef rep to buy another one, the Pampered Chef one works better than this one.\n\nHowever, this is not a horrible product. One drawback compared to the Pampered Chef one is that you can't see through this one to see how high the oil level is. You want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway, and when it is less than 1/3 full you need to fill it back up or it won't work as well. This unit is even more finicky than the Pampered Chef one about the level, it almost won't spray if the level is too low. But since you can't see through it, even holding it up to the light, you have to look down in and estimate how high it is. The reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is. You don't want to fill it all the way up, either.\n\nThen, you need to pump it more than the Pampered Chef one needed to be pumped. This one sprays a very fine spray, finer than the Pampered Chef one. And it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there. \n\nI think I know why my old one got clogged. So I'm trying something new: each time I'm done, before I put it away, I twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure. I think if you leave it pressured up all the time, like I did with my old one, it damages the nozzle over time. But time will tell if I'm right.\n\nAnother tip -- don't fill it with anything but olive oil. Other oils evaporate and leave a sticky/greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer. You know what I mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot, you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it. Olive oil doesn't do that, that's why I now don't use anything else on my stovetop (except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying).

I have overcome these problems by doing the following:\n\nI bought a gallon of distilled water that I use in the water compartment (at an ounce or two per use, a gallon will last a long time).  This prevents any mineral buildup and keeps the cooking cycle time to a minimum (keeping the stainless steel clean keeps heat transfer to a maximum, therefore speeding cooking time).  Every three or four uses, I wipe the water compartment with a damp paper towel to remove any accumulated debris that may have dripped down.  After cooking everything, I remove the egg poaching tray and while holding the egg in the tray with a plastic fork, tip it on its side over the sink to drain off any accumulated water, then remove the egg with the plastic fork.  I use store-brand spray oil and have never had an egg 'stick' in the pan.

First of all, many online retailers flat out state (inaccurately) that this model has a \"HEPA\" (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on Amazon (at least as of this writing) seems to indicate that it has one as well. I can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does *NOT* have a \"HEPA\" filter. More on that a little later in this review however.\n\nI found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number (i.e. 3670G). Be careful to understand the difference between what Amazon calls the 3670 (also called the 3670A in some places) and the 3670*G* models. They look identical and appear to be identical (both are yellow and black) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670G has the larger, 12 amp motor. Amazon carries both models and I almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum. For only about a $5-$10 difference in total price, I'm not sure why the smaller version is even offered. It only seems to confuse the matter. The 3670 also does *NOT* have the \"HEPA\" filter incidentally.\n\nI found the 3670G to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase. It is compact, very powerful and great for my needs. The noise...while high...is  quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans. The generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful, not having one is a reasonable trade-off in keeping the price down. The blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides (by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing).\n\nThe 3670G *does* require bags. It is not a \"bagless\" model however and while some may prefer a bagless model, I preferred a model that used bags. The bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what I consider to be the additional convenience (of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag).\n\nThe only reason I gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because I did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate. Three attachment tools are included, a crevice tool, a 10\" floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly-shaped brush (about 2\" wide) on the end. The combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick-up (3\" wide).\n\nIn my opinion, this cleaner badly needs a mid-sized brush and/or pick up tool that is about 4-5\" wide. The 2\" wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2\" wide, I found that I simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces (such as a wall for example) in order to cover the area needed. I would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4-5\" wide had been included. As it is, I am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra. \n\nFinally, a comment about the \"HEPA\" filter. Some people (particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air) may want cleaners that include this item. In my case, I did not want this since I don't need it and \"HEPA\" filters can be quite expensive to change and replace (unless you get a washable one...also expensive). Since many online descriptions I found were unclear whether the 3670G included this filter (some descriptions flatly stated that it does), I found myself calling the Eureka customer service number to find out for sure.\n\nIt turned out that even Eureka's own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it didn't have one. If you *do* want the \"HEPA\" filter, you would want the 3684D...which looks the same but  is red in color, slightly more expensive, and has more and better quality attachments as well as the \"HEPA\" filter.  By the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment (which I mentioned earlier that I think is needed on the 3670G), you are at the price of a 3684D. In that case, the 3684D may well be a better value for you, particularly if you like the \"HEPA\" filter.    \n\nOverall, I think \"The Boss\" series of canister vacuums is a great product. Eureka (and Amazon as well) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however.", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] When trying to decide if this model ( 3670G ) was the right vacuum for me , I found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it ' s features on the internet . . and from the manufacturer itself .

The main problems are: Balance of weight, and the switch.\n\nFirst, the switch: Because it is a cheap push-in button, which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on, you lose optimum control quickly. The handle is badly placed for this, as your thumb must always be on TOP of the handle and forward toward the front of it, but you can't hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting. In addition, keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife, but because the button sinks deep into the handle, so your thumb is inside the handle as you're trying to hold and control the knife: Quick cramp. Moreover, as you're pushing it in, if the food you're cutting is moist (like a turkey), juices may run onto the handle, your thumb--and into the hole into which you're pressing the button. NOT safe.

I've been using the Vinturi for 5 months now, on a variety of wines ... from a bottle of \"Two Buck Chuck\", to a nice '98 Vietti Barolo, to a bottle of 97' Phelps Insignia.

The bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine. These glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine. (They're also not bad for Rhones, though I prefer the Reidel Vinum syrah glass.)\n\nIf you drink a lot of burgundy, or pinot noir, or Italian Piedmont wines (barolo, barbaresco, langhe), I'd suggest Spiegelau's burgundy glass. If your preference is zinfandel or chianti, you're a bit out of luck with Spiegelau however. Their chianti glass isn't very good. Try the Riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines; you'll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet.\n\nSome reviewers have complained about breakage. I've seldom broken a glass, but it does occasionally happen during washing. My method is to clear the sink, run the water as hot as possible, put a bit of dishsoap in each glass. I then use a special ultra soft brush (which I got at a local wine shop for about $6) to clean the glass, removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim. Then rinse thoroughly with very hot water. Invert on cloth. After about half an hour, with the glasses almost dry, you can wipe them off with paper towels (which don't leave any lint behind) and put them away.\n\nThe main thing is never to lay them down in the sink, and wash one glass at a time.
