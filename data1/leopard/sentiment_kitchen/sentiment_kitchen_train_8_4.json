Often, I have to hold the vacuum in one hand (20 lbs.) while using the hose with attachment in the other.  This gives me over 3 ft. of reach and the suction is so great that the insect is \"gone\" within 1\" of the brush.  OK, the Lentek is rechargeable, doesn't have a power cord and is lite (albeit unwieldly).  After charging for a day the unit would pick up a 1/8\" spider but nothing larger.
