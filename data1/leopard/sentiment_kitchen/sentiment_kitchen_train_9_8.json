There's not much of an extension between the cleaning wand/brush and the actual machine, so while I was bending over to suck up hair and debris (what have you) from the stairs' carpet, I had the crazy noise blasting \"turbo\"-style directly into my ear.

While pouring the dirt into the trash can, a bit of dirt and dust fall onto the floor...nasty and what's the point in the dust cup if this happens? I had a Eureka Spin Brush vacuum contraption most recently (it died after 2 1/2 years) and I know from that experience that the dirt and dust should not be coating the cup, nor falling to the floor.\n   So, alas, my friends, I must pack up this marvel and take it back to the store.
