I almost bought the Bodum electric Santos until I read that for some users, the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature.\n\nAnyway, while at Target, I spent an hour looking at coffee makers, including the BUNN - which I really liked b/c it is made in the USA.  I decided to buy this one just to test it out.  I like the idea of having a removable water tank for cleaning (which the Bunn does not ahve) and a timer, which also the BUNN does not have.  The carafe is not bulky, and has a no-drip mouth.  Also, I have not seen any leaks so far, but water drops onto the warmer when i remove the basket to discard the filter.  Perhaps I should just remove the filter and not the basket.\n\nThe problem with most coffee makers is the steam.  After it condenses, the excess water has got no place to go other than hang around the basket or into the body.  \n\nAnyway, I also like the cool blue light in the front, and the coffee takes good - or as good as my braun which is what i've been used.  Overall, I don't think it's bad for 40 bucks.  If it develops a leak, I'll go buy the Bunn.
