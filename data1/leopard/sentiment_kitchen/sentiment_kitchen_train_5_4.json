I have a perfectly good Cuisipro mesh 13-inch screen, which does what it is supposed to do, namely reduce the spray of grease spewing onto the burners, walls, and floor.  Is it perfect?  No. But it definitely does most of the job, which is what I can't say about the Tovolo.  It has three fatal flaws.  First, the working end of the detachable metal handle is proportionally too small to securely and safely leverage the screen off. I had to use  one hand to steady the metal edge of the lid--hot hot hot--as I tried to wedge the handle under the screen's lip with my other hand.  Second, count the number of air holes in the silicone screen.  Then, count the holes in the metal mesh of the Cuisipro, or its ilk.  The purpose of a screen is to catch the grease, and this is the important part, to allow the steam to escape, otherwise the water vapor condenses back onto the food.  I first tried using the Tovolo to saute ground beef.  The beef began to stew in the water dripping from the surface of the screen.  Third, too much grease escapes around the edge of the screen because the metal rim bows from the heat.  In all fairness, the mesh type bows also, but not as much, possibly because the edge is thin and more pliable.\n\nThis product, imo, is just one more silicone kitchen gadget that does not work as well as the metal version.
