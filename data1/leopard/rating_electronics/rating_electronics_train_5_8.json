It was not a problem with DVD scratches, or failing to put the DVD's in the right way.\n\nI called Toshiba support, and they recommended a cure that sounded incredulous.  According to the manual, static electricity can \"build up\" in the DVD player, forcing you to physically unplug the REGZA for a few minutes to dissipate the charge.  Of course, to reduce cable clutter, the REGZA is plugged into a receptacle in an out of the way place, but to meet the requirements of the manual, that should be accessible.  The plug going into the back of the REGZA is not even designed so it could be unplugged there, it has to be unplugged at the receptacle.  And, it is not even a grounded power cord, which an electrical engineer I talked to about this said could contribute to the problem in the first place.  After the aforementioned \"hard reboot\" of the REGZA, it resumed playing retail DVD's again.  \n\nUnfortunately, the DVD player is not of high enough quality to play any of the DVD-R and DVD+R media I've tried so far (TDK, Memorex, Office Depot, Maxell) which were burned with a Sony DVDirect VRD-MC1.

I ran the new Sony DVP-NC85H straight to the LCD TV with HDMI. I got the blue HDMI working light and sound and image are transferred to the screen/LCD TV, but the quality is no better than my old Pioneer (non-progressive) player.  Did I do something wrong?  I can't see any color or resolution improvement. \n\nI may return this since it also introduced an 'echo' issue that is acknowledged in the Sony manual. The echo issue is between the HDMI sound transferred to the TV and the digital coax sound delivered via my receiver. With the old DVD player, no echo and excellent 5.1 sound from the TV and my receiver (simultaneous). The Sony manual states clearly that if you output via the HDMI, you cannot tune out any echo created by optical or coax digital DTS or Dolby Digital output.  The manual says to output the signal via PCM. However, that still introduces echo that cannot be removed.\n\nMaybe I am doing something wrong, but this player is definitely not an improvement over a standard, non-progressive player in my opinion.\n\nI thought maybe it was just the new LCD TV, but it displays excellent HD quality via HDMI input from my local cable companies digital tuner/DVR box.\n\nWhat are you guys comparing the supposed good quality on this player to?\n\nUpdate:\n\nI went back and tried comparing my old DVD player with this new Sony even more. I was able to change some of the settings in just the right combination on the Sony that improved the image. For the YCaCr/RGB setting, I tried RGB instead which got rid of lots of the red blocky imagery. I set the sharpness to 1 and the BNR on.  These 3 settings improved the image to the level where I will not return this DVD player. \n\nI still challenge someone from Sony to look at the image from my non-progressive DVD player (480i) and tell me how the 1080i (upscale) out of this unit is significantly better. Even looking at it 6\" from the screen. Honestly, I could pick out the pores on James Bonds face with the non-progressive 480i player, so maybe it is just really good, and the Sony just doesn't shine as much due to that.\n\nThe echo is better or worse depending on the DVD played. I have been asking friends with HD setups and they commented that echo is a problem with a lot of setups. TV sound is not usually used even as a center, I guess.\n\nReading the comments here helped me a lot.  Especially comments regarding the feedback on the TV for what grade of signal the TV is seeing. Mine display reports 1080i with the Sony connected, 480i with my old DVD player connected, as expected. I hadn't realized I could pull that up.\n\nI would give the Sony a 4 for features(Divx playback, SACD, etc)and a 3 for picture output for an average of 3.5, but the 1-5 scale entry above is frozen now in edit mode.\n\nAlso, I had reservations about non-shuffle, disk-to-disk abilities on this DVD player.  You can shuffle on one DVD/CD, but not between 1-5. I plan on working around that by playing MP3 disks for parties, Xmas, etc where I need the shuffle capability.
