Firstly, there is very little or no loss of video quality for resolutions 1600x1200 or above. The switch works perfectly as long as you have a USB Keyboard and USB Mice, EXCEPT, if the USB mouse you have is a trackball mice. I happen to own one of the Kensington Expert Pro Trackball mouse and it was not recoginzed by this switch. But you can always use a mouse through the USB hub provided in the switch.\n\nNow, the hub has its own advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, I started getting Divide by Zero blue screen errors but later on I realised that those are coming from some device driver corruption. I thought that not plugging a mouse in the USB mouse port of the switch was creating those errors but that was not the case.\n\nIf you ever get Divide by zero errors that means that your USB Hub on the switch is overloaded, i.e. you have devices that are not fast enough to switch and get corrupted after 3 or 4 switches or simply because the switch cannot utilize two usb devices simultaneously. I had a Creative Audigy NX USB sound card and my kensington mouse plugged into it and I got Blue Screen errors after every 10 minutes. The moment I plugged out the USB sound card, the computers are running stable since then but at the same time I am not able to use my Trackball mice and USB sound card simultaneously which I was able to in Belkin SOHO DVI switch, although that switch had different issues. \n\nI am giving this switch 5 star because it does what it says, although my expectations were a little bit higher so as to utilize 5.1 channel audio as well. Nevertheless, if a usb keybaord and mouse is the only thing you want to share between two computers along with your DVI monitor then this switch is perfect. \n\nHope my review helps those prospective buyers who are also planning to share their 5.1 or better usb sound cards with this switch.", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Hello , I recently purchased this Avocent Switchview 4 Port DVI KVM switch and I am happy to say that it meets most of my needs .
