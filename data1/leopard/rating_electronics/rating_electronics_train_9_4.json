(As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.  \n\nYou should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.\n\nWhile I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to \"turn it off\", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!\n\nI have a 42\" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26\" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!  \n\nI expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.

Originally I looked at the Trivoli (smart looking but didn't have a digital tuner), and the Boston Acoustics Radio Receptor at Target. Although the Trivoli looked very sharp and retro (which I loved), I later read several reviews that the manual tuner (non-digital) tended to drift off the radio signal. I then tried the Boston Acoustics (BA), and found that this radio sounded a bit richer and clearer than the Trivoli, however I didn't like the price ($150) and the look of it BA, which is all black plastic and doesn't have the classic retro charm of the Trivoli. The BA also brought in radio channels that the Trivoli wasn't picking up at the store through all the brick and metal of the Target building. Still uncomfortable with the BA's price, I went searching on the internet to find a cheaper BA, when I stumbled on the relatively unknown Sangean WR-1 (non digitial radio tuner) and the Sangean WR-2 (digital radio tuner with a clock radio AND a credit card sized remote control.) I ended up buying the Sangean WR-2 and am VERY PLEASED with my purchase. The radio is much more substantial in weight and size (about 50% bigger) than the Boston Acoustic and Trivoli radio. The WR-2 also looks very expensive and beautiful (yeah I loved superficial stuff like that) and has 6 presets (like in a car radio). But most importantly, I think this radio has a beautiful rich tone, an adjustable treble and bass, and radio presets, something that the other radio's didn't have. The Sangean is located next to my bed and looks absolutely stunning with its super shiny veneer box, and beautifully arranged controls. For $136 (which included shipping and handling), I am quite pleased with my purchase of this very handsome radio that has a rich and super clear tone (even though its not in stereo). I expect to enjoy my purchase for many more years to come and would high recommend anyone purchase the Sangean WR-2 radio", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] My boom box ran out of steam and I wanted to buy a small table top radio to listen to NPR .
