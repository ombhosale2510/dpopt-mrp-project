The GS605 behaves very badly when it comes to speed and duplex auto-negotiation, resulting in incorrect speed being negotiated with Marvell, some nVidia, and some Broadcom PHYs.  The GS105 does not suffer from these problems, proving the hardware in the GS105 differs from that of the GS605.\n\nThe GS105 also has an incredibly small AC adapter; it's no where near \"brick\" size.  However, on a power strip that has AC outlets next to one another (horizontal, not vertical), this product will probably block the AC outlet next to the one you install it in.  This won't happen with vertically-oriented power strips.  Just a FYI...\n\nThe reason I ranked this product 4/5 stars is because of temperature -- the GS105 runs incredibly warm (borderline hot) for such a small device.  Other users have reported the same issue.  It's a minor drawback, but is worth noting for others who may wonder the same question.\n\nIf the temperature is a big concern, consider purchasing a Hawking Technologies HGS5T, which is identical in functionality to this product, runs much cooler, but has a larger footprint, and a \"brick\" AC adapter", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] If you ' re looking for an affordable gigabit switch that doesn ' t suffer from strange auto - negotiation ( speed / duplex ) problems , this switch is for you .
