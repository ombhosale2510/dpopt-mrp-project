If you're not, buy something more expensive perhaps...\n\nPros:\n- It does protect the screen and click wheel nicely.\n- The flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely, which I guess helps if you happen to drop it.\n\nCons:\n- The belt clip is ridiculous. It's not a stationary clip. Instead it spins around, which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater. This product is not for the joggers.\n- The leather strap that comes with it is too short, which makes it difficult to operate the iPod when it's around your neck.\n- It seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under Pros above.

It leaves room for the iPod to slide up and down in the case. It makes accessing the HOLD switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down.
