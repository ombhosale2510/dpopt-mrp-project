Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS.\n \nI love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it.\nAnd let me say you can FEEL music if you want to.\n one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding.\n20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard.\n\nMaybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds!\n\nIn short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better.\nAlso, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on.\n \nIt improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" or, \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb.\n \nWith most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the \"BASS\" button: if the button is in the \"music\" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the \"movie\" position (I think \"music\" is a flatter frequency response).\n As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up:\nyes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B&W), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too.\nIt's a absolute pleasure to listen to.\n\n\nUpdate: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch.\nIf 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz.\nAlthough it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Maybe I ' m bias because I really like Yamaha , maybe , because I have kinda ' good ears or , it ' s the fat check sitting on my table from Yamaha ; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub - woofer .

The bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried RCA and not the digital. I have a sony 32\" Wega and I had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from XBOX. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV. There is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! Beware!
