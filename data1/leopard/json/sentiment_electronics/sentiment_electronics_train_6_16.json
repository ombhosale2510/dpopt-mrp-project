Even when the flap is closed, the microphone/headphone jacks are available, as are the REC/STOP/PLAY buttons.  If the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built-in microphone, you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well.  There is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the \"HOLD\" button on the side of the recorder.  Not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around, but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the \"HOLD\" button.  However, since the HOLD button is meant to slide down (away from the microphone) for it to be released, if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case, the resulting friction would actually unlock the \"HOLD\" button.\n\nThe belt loop is an adjustable velcro.  I would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop (so the case cannot come off the belt accidently) or a nice stiff clip (for easy access), or even a riveted snap button, but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options.

Or, being able to put it on your belt AFTER everything else (line-in MIC, headphone, recording/playing) is set up.  The relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case (mainly due to very small buttons), as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand, would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case.  The case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket, and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder.\n\nMy bias lies in that I like to use it as an MP3 player, and I wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive.  Placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such.\n\nI think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt.\n\nOn one positive note, I believe this is the first time that I was the first reviewer for anything from Amazon.

Unfortunately, my experience has me convinced that Linksys is a red-headed stepchild (my apologies to all you red-heads) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent.\n\nThat being said, the router does work out of the box, and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network routers.  My perusals of the DSL reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub-$300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies, and this one is certainly no exception.\n\n\nPros:\n\nThis router is configured to work right out of the box.  You can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on, and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen.\nThe HTML-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use.  You don't have to learn one single command line to configure this router.\nDefault configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the router did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests, forming a protective \"black hole\" on my IP for most uninvited packets.\n\nCons:\n\nNot all of the features worked out of the box.  Several of the links in the HTML command pages simply did not link to anything.  Strange that Linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don't point to anything.\nTurning on the poorly documented \"firewall\" feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests.  Sometimes the router responds \"port closed\" to all requests.  Sometimes it responds \"port closed\" to some and \"port open\" to others (the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next).  Never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration (with \"firewall\" inactive).  I'm not sure how the \"firewall\" in this router is configured to behave, but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature.\nThe router's DHCP functionality works great -- when it works.  It mysteriously disengages at random intervals, requiring a reboot (and sometimes a flash to factory defaults) to remedy.\nFlashing a new BIOS image is risky; router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer - or File13, if the warranty is out.\n\nFor what it's worth, I am still using this router.  It serves its basic purpose, and while its functionality issues are annoying, there are workarounds for all of them.
