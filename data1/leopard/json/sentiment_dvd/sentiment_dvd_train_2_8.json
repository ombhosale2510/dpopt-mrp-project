The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role.\n\nThis movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.\n\nThis movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie).\n\nTrue science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy.\n\nThis movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like \"Scanners\", \"Videodrome\", and the 1986 remake of \"The Fly\"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.)\n\nBesides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.  \n\nIn spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.

Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, \"The Descent\" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, \"The Descent\"\n\n\"The Descent\" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.\n\nAt the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.\n\nEven though \"The Descent\" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.\n\n\"The Descent\" is unrated and contains violence and language", "label": "positive", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co - workers in regards to movies to watch , at least when it comes to the horror genre .

The plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as \"well-worn,\" which seems to be a euphemism for \"shop-worn,\" \"clich\ufffd,\" or \"stupefyingly unoriginal.\" Here it is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir, heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it. Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz, throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career, publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs. (Speaking of whom: \"As It Is In Heaven\" was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the k\ufffdttbullar?) \n\nA standard feature of movies like this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade of didactic marionettes includes:\n\n-- Daniel's love interest, a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force;\n\n-- the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern Scandinavia;\n\n-- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It;\n\n-- the retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir, chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People. (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence, or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I can recall seeing is \"Best Boy,\" a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in \"There's Something About Mary,\" or turned into plaster saints as here.) \n\nSo, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of \"The O.C.\"  Run, don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main attraction.
