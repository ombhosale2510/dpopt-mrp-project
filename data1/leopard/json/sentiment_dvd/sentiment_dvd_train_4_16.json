[{"sentence1": "\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\", the second Harry Potter film in the series, was the first bit of the Harry Potter phenomenon I was every exposed to. I'd kind of avoided the boy wizard before then, but after seeing it those couple of years ago, even though I didn't entirely follow what was what and who was who, I realized it was pretty entertaining. After reading the second book recently, I picked up the DVD and watched it again. The series gets a little darker, like the books do, but unlike the book, I don't think the jump is as large, which I reckon is a good thing. Though I prefer the first film, it's still good to watch.\n\nIt's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) second year at Hogwart's wizards school, and after a shaky summer, he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot. It seems a certain Heir of Slytherin has opened the legendary Chamber of Secrets, loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students, literally! Many fingers point to Harry, Harry's finger points to Malfoy, and Ron's wand... well that doesn't point at all, as its broken and backfiring. What's this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders, haunted toilets, a rogue Quidditch bludger and a self-flagellating house elf? Can Harry, Ron and Hermione figure things out?\n\nAll the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film, plus the boys' voices are breaking. In some scenes they're kind of croaky sounding, in other scenes they have their child voice, and in others their voices broken through, not neccesarily in that order. There's a couple of new kids, (like Colin Creevey) and they are just as well cast as the others. The new adults are well cast too. Though not my favorite performance of his career, Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh makes an interesting Gilderoy Lockhart, the vain second year dark arts teacher. He played it a lot more subtley than I expected him to. Ex-Fast Show comedian Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, which I reckon was a great choice. I missed some of the cast from the last film though. You hardly see Warwick Davis (who plays Professor Flitwick), let alone hear him say anything, and John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick, who has a rather significant deathday party in the book, has hardly anything to do here except get petrified.\n\nThere were other things cut out too, like the catching of the garden gnomes at the Weasley's. The fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though. Personally, I like to think of the Harry Potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion, rather like the pictures in the world of Hogwarts. They give an idea of what the book would look like, an impression.\n\nSpecial features include an interview with author J.K. Rowling and script writer Steve Kloves, as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors. There's also slick virtual tours through Diagon Alley, Dumbledore's Office and Gilderoy Lockhart's Classroom (a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is, complete with gushing praises from the narrator). There's also a couple of games: you can visit the Chamber of Secrets after answering some Harry Potter trivia, you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest (which I found frustrating but addictive). There's also a trivia game about what spell does what too. Unlike the first DVD, you don't have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes, you're able to go to them straight from the main menu. Just as well, there's 19 of them, and some of them are pretty significant. Notable scenes include Harry's close encounter with the Malfoys in the dark magic shop, Harry discovering that Filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence. I wish they'd left some of these scenes in, particularly the ones where Harry Potter questions his nature, is he a good wizard or a bad wizard. That was some mighty fine character development cut there! There's also a gallery of design drawings and a section called \"Colin Creevey's Darkroom\" where you can select pictures of various characters, then play them in a slideshow of sorts.\n\nApparently there's a whole stack of stuff in the DVD ROM features, but I just couldn't get them to work on my laptop's DVD drive. Using InterActual player (the player that many Warner Brothers films have you install to play their DVDs), it says there is a script error, and when I tried Windows Media Player 9 and Cyberlink PowerDVD 4.0, though it ran the DVD and everything else with it fine, the DVD acted as if it wasn't in a DVD ROM drive, telling me that if I put the DVD into my PC's drive I'd get all these wonderful features. It was in my DVD drive! Aggh! It IS in a DVD drive. Maybe its just my type of laptop (BenQ DH5100U, 1.5 Gigahertz). Ah well, it looked like it would have been really fun, especially for fans of the series.\n\nAll in all, its definitely worth a look for Harry Potter fans, but I would recommend you read the book first", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] \" Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets \" , the second Harry Potter film in the series , was the first bit of the Harry Potter phenomenon I was every exposed to .

The story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers, only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of Ed Harris , who in my opinion had the best performance overall. Ed (Mr. Fogarty) is in the Mob and seems to think that Viggo (Tom) is Joey Cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge. Tom, and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) have two children, a farmhouse, and a diner and Tom insist that he isn't Joey. The story goes on, dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex. Maria Bello has never been one of my favorite actresses, I think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair (evidence is in the movie) she brings the level of believability down and makes Viggo's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent. We soon figure out that Tom is indeed Joey and after we say goodbye to Ed Harris's character (of which I was just disappointed to see, c'mon he was awesome!) Tom/Joey goes to see his brother, Richie (William Hurt) to make amends for disappearing, and soon realizes that Richie wants him dead. So more killing, more blood, and tom/joey is finally free of his past, if his family would take him back. Of course they do, really, his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table (his daughter sets a place for him...) and the movie is over. There was no Aha moment, the action wasn't anything new, the story was predictable and the setting was \"been there done that\". Viggo is an amazing actor, and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the Tom/Joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into, the shift of reality was barely noticeable. Maria Bello, needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough, sexy, stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly, it doesn't work for her, she cannot pull it off.

White rabbit is a sawdust-stuffed real rabbit that escaped from the taxidermy stand, caterpillar is an old stocking with dentures and glass eyes, Mad Hatter is a marionette and March Hare is a wind-up stuffed toy rabbit with a loose button eye.  Devoted Alice fans may have a different reaction, but I found Jan Svankmajer's Alice disturbing and, at times, tedious.\n Everyday objects - the stuff in Alice's room - become the stuff of the dream.  Playing cards become Red Queen and entourage, the White Rabbit has a nasty looking set of incisors and a distressing tendency to shed his sawdust guts, Alice herself becomes her own blank-faced doll.  There's no law that says Alice has to be bright and cuddly, but it sure helps.  Whether intentional or not, Svankmajer's Alice is grim and nightmarish.  \n\nSvankmajer animates figures in motion- real figures, like dolls and stuffed and mounted rabbits and such - but he doesn't animate facial expressions.  Combine that with the flat tone of voice by the film's narrator - ALICE is narrated by the actress who plays Alice, dubbed into English, or course - and the film has a flat, dead feeling.  The film, oddly enough for an animated feature, is leadenly paced. Some scenes seem to run on forever.  The tea party with the Mad Hatter (a marionette) and the March Hare (a bedraggled plush toy bunny with an annoyingly ill-attached button eye) runs on and on, the animation repeating itself way past our limit of patience.  The Mad Hatter wants a new cup of tea (`Change chairs!'), the March Hare scoots around in a wheelchair.  The new seats are taken, the tea is poured, the Mad Hatter wants a news cup of tea (`Change chair!') and on, and on, and on.  Sheesh - thought that scene would never end.\n\n  Look - I'm not that big a fan of Carroll's Alice stories in the first place, but the movie adaptations of his stories - be they Disney's animated movie or the 1933 full-length feature with Ned Sparks as the Catepillar and Sterling Holloway as the frog - all have had something going for them.  Comedy, for one thing. Svankmajer's inspiration is laudable, but his execution is often disappointing.  His Alice is dark, grim, humorless and not everyone's cup of chai.    It's like listening to a quiet sonata played by an acid jazz band - it's familiar enough, probably good enough for the converted, but hard for the uninitiated to embrace and unlikely to win any new fans.", "label": "positive", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Weird , whacked out interpretation of Lewis Carroll ' s Alice in Wonderland that combines live - action with some stop - action animation to create a creeped out dreamscape .

This film isn't \"The Great Escape\" and even though he would probably like to think otherwise, Bruce Willis isn't Steve McQueen.  Even though Willis received top billing, this is a Colin Farrell vehicle. \n \n2.  The vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the Reagan administration, much less World War II.  \"Hart's War\" may just as well be a film about a POW camp during the War of 1812.  Anything with Vin Diesel or the Rock would be bound to sell more tickets.\n\n3.  As far as depicting life in a POW camp, \"Hart's War\" is pretty much on par with \"Hogan's Heroes\".  The Germans are nice guys with guns who don't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything.  Where did the GI's get all those cigarettes, anyway?\n\n4.  Any Stalag Luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the Bruce Willis character as look at him.  As depicted in \"Hart's War\", the camp commandant (as portrayed by Marcel Lures) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the German Army.  His collection of American jazz/blues records is a cute writer's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, or of the type of men who were in charge of German POW camps.  In reality, the Marcel Lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic.\n\n5.  The storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in POW camps, one good example being the POW's who were tried and hung in Andersonville;  However, the whole idea that the camp's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a Jerry Springer type advocate is ludicrous.\n\n6.  The idea that during the trial, a group of POW's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting.  Not only did nothing like this ever happen during World War II, it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions.  The German army simply wasn't that stupid.\n\n7.  I saw this film once and didn't like it.  I thought that maybe the second time would be better.  It wasn't.\n\n8.  Beyond being sheer Hollywood political correctness, \"Hart's War\" seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment.  It ignores the real focus of life in such a Stalag which, for most POW's, was just day to day survival.  Also, the soldiers who served in our armed forces during World War II and also happened to be African Americans weren't spineless, hapless dopes.\n\n9.  Bruce Willis playing the same role in variations of \"Die Hard\" over and over and over again is tiring.\n\n10.

I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get. \nOh, and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil, just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing.

This ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950's and Gianni S. is  downright embarrassing. The costuming there makes everyone look absurd.

It is great to have this opera on DVD but otherwise it was a big  disappointment. No goosebumps here. I just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the Met broadcast with Scotto in all three of the 1 acters. What a delight -- some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that's what these need. Scotto was incredible in Suor Angelica.

I'm not disappointed really, I don't regret buying it in any sense, it's just that this DVD isn't very good at all. It doesn't attempt to make any insight, which isn't something I particularly care for anyway. What each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers. I can't imagine anyone learning something they didn't already know from them. It's mostly told through pictures when it seems there's option to use video. The Dahmer documentary, made in 1993, doesn't feature anything of interest. There's no interview with his father or anything, just a voice telling a story over pictures we've all seen before, with occassional clips of victims' families in court. The Gacy one, made in '96, is the same. There's also a program, made in 1997,on criminal profiling. This look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling. It's told often with video rather then photos, which is good, but still they're somewhat boring subjects. The Criminal Profiler, Dahmer, and Gacy are all episodes from the A&amp;E series Investigative Reports, if you didn't realise. The last program is on Charles Manson. It's quite different from the others on the disc. Made in 1997, it originally aired on television as Biography: Charles Manson: Journey Into Evil. I don't with have any interest in Manson, but I guess it's ok. It features significant interviews with Manson and main female members of the Family. All programs run for about one hour or more.
