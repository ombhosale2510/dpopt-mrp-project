It's a real cinematic treat, shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are growing up and preparing to enter the world.\n\nLana Turner has never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams. \n\nOne day at Coney Island, Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), whom Lora mistakes for the maid.  When told by her that she's the mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child. \n\nThe angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage. Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night. \n\nAt the same time, Lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white.\n\nImitation of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get.  Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization, but has trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous. \n\nAnnie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's ultimate paradox.\n\nLora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them. \n\nLora gets her career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother. \n\nUnder Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring. \n\nThe screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost.

Foley will go down in history for being able to control the crowd, being violent & hardcore, and also being able to be one of the most loveable characters in wrestling.  This DVD is a great collection of violent matches involing Foley himself along with his famous promos & extra matches.\n\nDisc One:\nCactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader - During a time where Vader was just killing his opponetts, Cactus Jack was able to hold his own and go toe to toe with Vader.  This also includes exclusive footage that was censored on TBS.\n\nChicago Street Fight: Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. Nasty Boys - This was one of the \"stiffest\" matches I've ever seen as these guys were legitlity brawling & hitting each other with the weapons and you just see at one point Cactus get his head cracked with a shovel on the floor.  Honestly, one of the best Nasty Boys matches I've seen.\n\nCactus Jack vs. Sabu - This match was more about the post match brawl between the two than the match itself.  Foley admits before the match that the hype & reputation between these two set a standard that nobody could match.\n\nCactus Jack vs. Chris Candido - One of Cactus's best \"wrestling\" matches eventhough it's not really anything memorable.\n\nTexas Death Match: Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman - Foley openily admits that this match wasn't pretty as Sandman got a concussion at the beginning & really threw everything off.  They would go on to have better matches (as seen on the ECW Cactus Jack DVD).\n\nCactus Jack & Raven vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer - The classic ECW wild weapons brawl as they had everything including the kitchen sink.  It would get sick as you see things like Cactus sliceing Funk's arm with glass.  With cameo's from Taz & Bill Alfonzo, this is worth watching again & again.\n\nCactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck - Cactus' last match in ECW against the man he helped make a superstar.\n\nDisc 1 Extras:\nPost-Vader match interview - Interview a week after his match with Vader\n\nFalls Count Anywhere: Cactus Jack vs. Sting - This match has commentary from Coach & Foley where they talked about his storytelling throughout the match & his time in WCW.  This was Cactus' best WCW match in his opinion and it really is.  Action all over the ringside area along with great inring storytellin (watch him work on Sting's ribs).\n\nCactus Jack spits on WCW Tag Team Championship belt - The promo Cactus did after this Sabu match showing that the WCW Tag Title didn't mean as much as his pride that he lost to Sabu.  This is followed by a Heyman promo regarding that match.\n\nThe \"Cane Dewey\" Promo - Foley's favorite promo done during this \"anti-hardcore\" stint in ECW where he talks about the fans making a sign suggesting that Sandman canes his 5 year old son.\n\n\"Anti-Hardcore\" promo - Another promo where Foley talks down to the ECW fans for being so bloodthirsty.\n\nCactus Jack vs. Sabu - The Cactus/Sabu rematch that includes commentary from Foley & Coach.  This match is better quality (both in video & in ring action) than the previous one.\n\nMick Foley's ECW Farewell Speech - Foley says goodbye to the ECW fans.\n\n\"Jack\"\" Foley & Les Thornton vs. British Bulldogs - Mick's WWE debut that results in his having a dislocated jaw thanks to the Dynamite Kid.\n\nWWE Confidential feature - Mick talks about all the charity work he did during his 18 month absence in WWE and what led to his coming back to WWE.\n\nHidden Easter Eggs:\nMick Foley jumps off the roof of his house (On disc one, go to the \"Extras\" menu, highlight \"Main Menu\" and press the left arrow twice.)\n\nDude Love Entrance Video (On disc one, go to the \"Chapters\" menu.  Highlight \"Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido\" and press the right arrow.)\n\nDisc 2\nIntroducting Mankind - One of the Mankind \"dungeon\" promos he did before his debut\n\nMankind vs. Shawn Michaels - This was Foley's best match of his career and probably the best match of 1996.  HBK's high flyin' lucha libre influenced style mixed with Mankind's hardcore daredevil style made for one hell of a match.\n\nFalls Count Anywhere: Cactus Jack vs. Triple H - Tables, trash cans, and weapons galore in this brawl.  One of the best matches in RAW history\n \nMick Foley vs. Terry Funk - A throwback to their ECW brawls as both of these wrestlers are just using their own bodies are wrecking machines.  Stone Cold on commentary just adds to the craziness of this match.\n\nDude Love vs. Stone Cold - The best match in the history of Dude Love as it's another brawl all over ringside.  McMahon, Brisco, Patterson, and Undertaker all have cameos in this match.\n\nMankind vs. The Undertaker - Foley's most memorable performance as he takes a beating that you have to see to believe.\n\nMankind vs. The Rock - Foley wins the title for the first time with help from Stone Cold.  This match itself isn't as memorable as their Survivor Series match or their later matches like the Halftime Heat match.\n\nStreet Fight Match: Cactus Jack vs. Triple H - This is the match that catapulted Triple H into the bonified main event superstar that he is today.  Thumbtacks, barbed wire, and blood all over the place.\n\nDisc 2 Extras: \nMankind teasers - Early Mankind promos that focued on his missing ear\n\nMusic To My Ear - Another Mankind \"dungeon\" promo\n\nMind Games - This was a promo Mankind did before the Mind Games PPV where he insulted ECW (they were in Philidelphia) to insure the fans wouldn't cheer him.\n\nJim Ross interviews Mankind - This was the interview that slowly started Mankind's face turn.\n\nThe Birth of Mr. Socko - Mankind visits Mr. McMahon in the hospital\n\nMick and Al Snow in Vegas - They're stalked by a fan \n\nMore Mick and Al in Vegas - Mick and Al ride the rides, join a lounge band and visit a gentleman's club \n\nCommissioner Foley & Kurt Angle - The Commish books a match \n\nHidden Easter Eggs:\nChef Boyardee commercial (On disc two, on the \"Chapters\" menu, highlight \"Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind\" and press the left arrow twice.)\n\nDX skit \"Have A Bad Day\" (On disc two, on the \"Extras\" menu, highlight \"Birth of Mr. Socko\" and press the right arrow twice.) \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDE", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] A hardcore legend in Mick Foley ' wrestling career is spotlighted here on this DVD .
