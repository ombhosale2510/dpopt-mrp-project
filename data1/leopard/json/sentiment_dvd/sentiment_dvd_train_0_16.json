She was raised a devout Catholic girl and the fact that she is \"with child\" shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her. Distraught by her banishment from her family, Magdalena turns to her Uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonzales) who lives with her cousin, Carlos (Jesse Garcia) in a small apartment in Echo Park, Los Angeles. Carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood. What results is a mnage a trios between Carlos and the couple, one a television producer and the other a British citizen. Carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes Magdalena's new family unit.\n\tIn effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that Carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper-middle class men. What results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in American films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with.\n\tPerformances are excellent in the film and the directors Richard Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen. Emily Rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and Chalo Gonzalez as Uncle Tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten.

But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's \"never even seen the inside of a courtroom\". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a \"Code Red\" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the \"Code Red\", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as \"code, honor & discipline\". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not \"handle the truth\"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous \"You Can't Handle the Truth\" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend \"A Few Good Men\"", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] The military courtroom drama , \" A Few Good Men \" is one of those films , that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it ' s own .

As with D.W Griffth, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo, he is right up their amoung silent icons. This movie, starring H.B. Warner as Jesus is a truely a jewel of a film. Everyone knows the story, but it is told very well here. Demille knew his bible films, like Ten Commandments(1924,1956) Samson And Delilah and this movie, The King Of Kings. The film maybe dated a tiny bit, but can the story of Jesus be dated. I love Jesus movies, like Jesus Of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told. The 1961 King of Kings, and the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. And the story of Christ was also tackled in the 1916 D.W Griffth classic Intolerence. But this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail. The special effects are amazing for 1927, the crucifixion scene is astondishing,and a scene in color, which is the resurrection scene.The cast of characters is also amazing. In our era of movies, if you need a big scene, a will have only 100 people, and CGI the other tens of thousands. Since there was no CGI back in 1927, or computers for that matter, they directors like Demillie and Griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics. I know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old, they are a gateway to the past. Without those groundbreaking films, no one would care about movies. Those early silents were the catalyst for what would become. I would recommend this film.
