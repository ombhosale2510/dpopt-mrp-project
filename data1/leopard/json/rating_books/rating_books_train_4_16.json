Author David A. Crenshaw Ph.D. presents his theory of the tasks of mourning that must be accomplished in order for the grieving individual to attain a healthy resolution to the loss.  These tasks appear to owe an acknowledgement to the five stages of grief proposed by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.  Crenshaw goes on to apply his seven tasks to six identified life cycle stages:  preschool children, school-age children, adolescents, young adults, adults in midlife, and the elderly, using abbreviated case histories as examples.  \nThe book provides an overview of the grieving process and some basic suggestions for interventions with people in the various age groups.  It does not, however, give the amount of in-depth information and hands-on detail that would be required to help a counselor develop proficiency in counseling the bereaved.  In attempting to cover such a wide array of populations in a small book, Crenshaw sacrifices specificity.  The longest chapter is devoted to the preschool aged child with the main thrust of his recommendations being monologues that the counselor delivers to the child.  He only minimally mentions play therapy, arguably the most effective type of therapy for children in this age group.  This reviewer finds the omission of play therapy techniques for the bereaved child to be the most serious lack in this book.\nBereavement is an interesting and highly readable book that gives some good basic information.  The counselor interested in developing effective grief resolution therapy skills would do well to use this book as a starting point from which to begin building her skills and then follow it with more in-depth publications devoted to the specific population she is counseling.\n\nReviewed by:\nKathleen C.

I'd like to claim that the book changed my life, in addition I read several other books written by Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, Zig Ziglar, Jeff Keller and many more.  However, I found that Think and Grow Rich served as a template to everyone else's work. Napoleon Hill presented his discoveries quite clearly, and if applied correctly these ideas were meant to change anyone's life.  Ever since then, I've found a way to buy a successful window cleaning franchise based out of St. Louis.  I'm proud to say that I couldn't have done it without the help of Napoleon Hill and his book Think and Grow Rich.  This book was not only written to get rich, but also to change people in a positive way.  Whether you want to make millions or be a better athlete, this book will definitely help you achieve any goals.  Like Napoleon Hill said, \"Whatever your mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve,\" these are the words to live by!

He lived with his parents on the family estate of Orgonon in the backwoods of Maine.  Not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy, but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy.  As Wilhelm's only child, Peter was one of the first recipients of Reich's therapy methods, which involved special forms of touch, energy channeling, \"softening the stomach\", and inducing vomiting (in Peter's account). Peter was also made lieutenant in his father's defensive squad that protected the earth from UFO attacks through the use of \"accumulator guns\".  The elder Reich eventually got in trouble with the FDA for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness.  The court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court.  Not long after being sent to prison, he passed away, apparently of heart failure.  Upon his father's death, Peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father's legacy of brilliance and madness.  Up until the time of his father's death, he had believed everything his father told him, not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father's version of reality was from most other people's, nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father's explanations and standard scientific approaches.  In this book, Peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not, what is his, and what is his father's.\n\nThe book reads like the proverbial onion-chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if what Peter is describing actually took place, or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head.  By the end of the book, the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in Peter's mind, but, like Peter, may not be capable of saying what really happened.

It is very readable for the most part, although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going.  More illustrations would have helped here.  There are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging, cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain, but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage.\n\nPinker's lively, humorous style is often commented on but I sometimes found it wearing.  He will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting, then list a few more, then add \"I could not resist some more...\" and so on.  I sometimes wished he would just get on with it.\n\nA major problem with his nativist approach, which other reviewers have commented on, is that many examples he lists of usages that English speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind.  Most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book, linguists have been busy recording them in the field.  The thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter, where he argues that 'you and I' and 'you and me' are equally correct in all circumstances, because 'the pronoun is free to have any case it wants'.  But if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about?  If 'between you and I' sounds instinctively wrong to me and 'between you and me' sounds instinctively wrong to someone else, does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene?  I doubt it.\n\nThe title itself is problematic.  'Instinct' is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is, it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense.  Early in the book, Pinker admits as much, but determines to use the word anyway, a use that owes more to marketing than to science.\n\nStill, this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available.  If you are new to linguistics, start here rather than with Chomsky, but please go on to read Geoffrey Sampson's work, perhaps starting with his website, to get an alternative view.  As with most academic disputes, the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle.  Since Chomsky's early work, the nativists have toned down their claims considerably, while their opponents have made concessions.  On page 34 of this book, Pinker says, \"No one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene, but the search is on.\"  More than a decade later, the search is still on.

Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.\n\nI suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year. \n\nOf course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of \"She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination.

David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book.\n\n\tThis period in question covers 1929-1945, which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant, but in reality was anything but insignificant. From the early stages of the depression in the late 1920s during the Hoover Administration, to the Atomic bombs used against Japan in 1945 during the Truman Presidency which ended the war in the Pacific, this books covers many important people and events in both the social, political and economic realms of American life.\n\n\tThe Depression years are the focus of the first part of the book (obviously) and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis, how the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations confronted the crisis, how the American people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the New Deal was both successful and unsuccessful. Hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation, contrary to what many believe, Hoover was an extremely capable man, but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as Franklin Roosevelt proved during his presidency.\n\n\tThe New Deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be, but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the New Deal's objectives, it wasn't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery, only World War II would bring that about. I think I'm summarizing Kennedy's view on the New Deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program. There is so much covered that it's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely.\n\n\tThe turmoil in Europe caused by Hitler's regime, the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before Pearl Harbor, and the eventual American intervention and allied efforts to defeat the German and Japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book. Kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding America's entry and involvement in the Second World War from the mobilization of the country's industrial and manpower-womanpower supply, to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the European and Pacific fronts, and the people who played such important roles in the conflict.\n\n\tThe major battles fought, the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies, the changing nature on the American homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many Americans after World War II are all covered. Difficult subjects aren't left out either, including the internment of Japanese-Americans, the status of African Americans during the war years, and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides, most especially in the Pacific Theater of the war.\n\n\tThis book is all-encompassing, well-written, yet very analytical when it needs to be. Quite rare. Maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate, which is not unusual when writing history. He at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made, lost opportunities and the likes, and that should be discussed. He does disagree with the theory, I suppose advocated by some, that Roosevelt wanted Pearl Harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen. Some sections of the book require a good working knowledge of certain issues, but overall it is well-written.

The review mentioned that stories like, \"The Snow Queen\", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American translators.  With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in possession of a very particular copy of \"The Snow Queen\" and I was able to test this theory myself.  Now due to the wacky nature of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this Anderson story.  You will see that some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us all) to Mary Engelbreit.  None of these, however, are the version that I am reviewing.  After careful consideration, I selected the edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella.  With this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life.\n\t\nMost people don't remember that \"The Snow Queen\" begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad.  By a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere.  If these splinters enter your eye, everything will look ugly to you.  If they enter your heart, it will turn instantly to ice.  Got it?  Good.  Cause sure enough, two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named Kai.  When this happens he stops playing with his best playmate Gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale Snow Queen.  Gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures.  She escapes an overly loving old witch, is taken in by a prince and princess, falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin, and at last saves Kai from the Snow Queen herself.  By the end of the book, neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it.\n\t\nObviously \"The Snow Queen\" is one big ole story about growing up.  The idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well that's just another way of describing adolescence, is it not?  Andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale, \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\", in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman.  Heck, \"Tam Lin\" was probably an influence as well.  The best version of this particular story I ever read was by Kara Dalkey.  It was a tale named, \"The Lady of the Ice Garden\" and can be found in \"Firebirds: An Anthology of Original Science Fiction and Fantasy\".  It is not, however, appropriate for children.  Kids today will probably look at \"The Snow Queen\" and instantly think of the White Witch from \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\".  I cannot think, however, that this is a bad thing.  \n\t\nAs for the Jeffers/Ehrlich version, it's all right.  As an illustrator, Jeffers has apparently decided to make Kai and Gerta definitely children.  I guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the Snow Queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs.  Jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the Snow Queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair.  There is the odd stylistic choice here and there, though.  When Gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed, it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals.  I can't think that they're comfortable (or even particularly practical).  The illustrations have been created, according to the book, \"using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes.  They were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased\".  As a result, the book is as soft as a colored pencil, but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink.\n\t\nObviously I don't know enough about the original version of \"The Snow Queen\" (or, as Andersen called it, \"Sneedronningen\") to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots.  At any rate, it tells the full story, warts and all, and will provide them with what may well be the most Freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains.
