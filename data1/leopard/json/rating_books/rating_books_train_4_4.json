Instead of going into education I decided to pursue the idea of starting my own business.  That's when I decided to research books about success and what it takes.

Right after I finished reading it, I decided to purchase my own copy.  It was possibly the most important decision I've made in my life.  I'd like to claim that the book changed my life, in addition I read several other books written by Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, Zig Ziglar, Jeff Keller and many more.  However, I found that Think and Grow Rich served as a template to everyone else's work. Napoleon Hill presented his discoveries quite clearly, and if applied correctly these ideas were meant to change anyone's life.  Ever since then, I've found a way to buy a successful window cleaning franchise based out of St. Louis.  I'm proud to say that I couldn't have done it without the help of Napoleon Hill and his book Think and Grow Rich.  This book was not only written to get rich, but also to change people in a positive way.  Whether you want to make millions or be a better athlete, this book will definitely help you achieve any goals.  Like Napoleon Hill said, \"Whatever your mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve,\" these are the words to live by!

David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book.\n\n\tThis period in question covers 1929-1945, which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant, but in reality was anything but insignificant. From the early stages of the depression in the late 1920s during the Hoover Administration, to the Atomic bombs used against Japan in 1945 during the Truman Presidency which ended the war in the Pacific, this books covers many important people and events in both the social, political and economic realms of American life.\n\n\tThe Depression years are the focus of the first part of the book (obviously) and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis, how the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations confronted the crisis, how the American people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the New Deal was both successful and unsuccessful. Hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation, contrary to what many believe, Hoover was an extremely capable man, but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as Franklin Roosevelt proved during his presidency.\n\n\tThe New Deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be, but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the New Deal's objectives, it wasn't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery, only World War II would bring that about. I think I'm summarizing Kennedy's view on the New Deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program. There is so much covered that it's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely.\n\n\tThe turmoil in Europe caused by Hitler's regime, the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before Pearl Harbor, and the eventual American intervention and allied efforts to defeat the German and Japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book. Kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding America's entry and involvement in the Second World War from the mobilization of the country's industrial and manpower-womanpower supply, to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the European and Pacific fronts, and the people who played such important roles in the conflict.\n\n\tThe major battles fought, the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies, the changing nature on the American homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many Americans after World War II are all covered. Difficult subjects aren't left out either, including the internment of Japanese-Americans, the status of African Americans during the war years, and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides, most especially in the Pacific Theater of the war.\n\n\tThis book is all-encompassing, well-written, yet very analytical when it needs to be. Quite rare. Maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate, which is not unusual when writing history. He at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made, lost opportunities and the likes, and that should be discussed. He does disagree with the theory, I suppose advocated by some, that Roosevelt wanted Pearl Harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen. Some sections of the book require a good working knowledge of certain issues, but overall it is well-written. I've studied this period before, but I found this book very rewarding in that I also learned quite a bit I knew little or nothing about.

The review mentioned that stories like, \"The Snow Queen\", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American translators.  With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in possession of a very particular copy of \"The Snow Queen\" and I was able to test this theory myself.  Now due to the wacky nature of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this Anderson story.  You will see that some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us all) to Mary Engelbreit.  None of these, however, are the version that I am reviewing.  After careful consideration, I selected the edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella.  With this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life.\n\t\nMost people don't remember that \"The Snow Queen\" begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad.  By a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere.  If these splinters enter your eye, everything will look ugly to you.  If they enter your heart, it will turn instantly to ice.  Got it?  Good.  Cause sure enough, two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named Kai.  When this happens he stops playing with his best playmate Gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale Snow Queen.  Gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures.  She escapes an overly loving old witch, is taken in by a prince and princess, falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin, and at last saves Kai from the Snow Queen herself.  By the end of the book, neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it.\n\t\nObviously \"The Snow Queen\" is one big ole story about growing up.  The idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well that's just another way of describing adolescence, is it not?  Andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale, \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\", in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman.  Heck, \"Tam Lin\" was probably an influence as well.  The best version of this particular story I ever read was by Kara Dalkey.  It was a tale named, \"The Lady of the Ice Garden\" and can be found in \"Firebirds: An Anthology of Original Science Fiction and Fantasy\".  It is not, however, appropriate for children.  Kids today will probably look at \"The Snow Queen\" and instantly think of the White Witch from \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\".  I cannot think, however, that this is a bad thing.  \n\t\nAs for the Jeffers/Ehrlich version, it's all right.  As an illustrator, Jeffers has apparently decided to make Kai and Gerta definitely children.  I guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the Snow Queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs.  Jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the Snow Queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair.  There is the odd stylistic choice here and there, though.  When Gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed, it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals.  I can't think that they're comfortable (or even particularly practical).  The illustrations have been created, according to the book, \"using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes.  They were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased\".  As a result, the book is as soft as a colored pencil, but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink.\n\t\nObviously I don't know enough about the original version of \"The Snow Queen\" (or, as Andersen called it, \"Sneedronningen\") to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots.  At any rate, it tells the full story, warts and all, and will provide them with what may well be the most Freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains.
