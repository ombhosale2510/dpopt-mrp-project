David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book.\n\n\tThis period in question covers 1929-1945, which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant, but in reality was anything but insignificant. From the early stages of the depression in the late 1920s during the Hoover Administration, to the Atomic bombs used against Japan in 1945 during the Truman Presidency which ended the war in the Pacific, this books covers many important people and events in both the social, political and economic realms of American life.\n\n\tThe Depression years are the focus of the first part of the book (obviously) and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis, how the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations confronted the crisis, how the American people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the New Deal was both successful and unsuccessful. Hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation, contrary to what many believe, Hoover was an extremely capable man, but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as Franklin Roosevelt proved during his presidency.\n\n\tThe New Deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be, but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the New Deal's objectives, it wasn't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery, only World War II would bring that about. I think I'm summarizing Kennedy's view on the New Deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program. There is so much covered that it's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely.\n\n\tThe turmoil in Europe caused by Hitler's regime, the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before Pearl Harbor, and the eventual American intervention and allied efforts to defeat the German and Japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book. Kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding America's entry and involvement in the Second World War from the mobilization of the country's industrial and manpower-womanpower supply, to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the European and Pacific fronts, and the people who played such important roles in the conflict.\n\n\tThe major battles fought, the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies, the changing nature on the American homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many Americans after World War II are all covered. Difficult subjects aren't left out either, including the internment of Japanese-Americans, the status of African Americans during the war years, and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides, most especially in the Pacific Theater of the war.\n\n\tThis book is all-encompassing, well-written, yet very analytical when it needs to be. Quite rare. Maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate, which is not unusual when writing history. He at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made, lost opportunities and the likes, and that should be discussed. He does disagree with the theory, I suppose advocated by some, that Roosevelt wanted Pearl Harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen.

The review mentioned that stories like, \"The Snow Queen\", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American translators.  With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in possession of a very particular copy of \"The Snow Queen\" and I was able to test this theory myself.  Now due to the wacky nature of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this Anderson story.  You will see that some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us all) to Mary Engelbreit.  None of these, however, are the version that I am reviewing.  After careful consideration, I selected the edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella.  With this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life.\n\t\nMost people don't remember that \"The Snow Queen\" begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad.  By a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere.  If these splinters enter your eye, everything will look ugly to you.  If they enter your heart, it will turn instantly to ice.  Got it?  Good.  Cause sure enough, two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named Kai.  When this happens he stops playing with his best playmate Gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale Snow Queen.  Gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures.  She escapes an overly loving old witch, is taken in by a prince and princess, falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin, and at last saves Kai from the Snow Queen herself.  By the end of the book, neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it.\n\t\nObviously \"The Snow Queen\" is one big ole story about growing up.  The idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well that's just another way of describing adolescence, is it not?  Andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale, \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\", in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman.  Heck, \"Tam Lin\" was probably an influence as well.  The best version of this particular story I ever read was by Kara Dalkey.  It was a tale named, \"The Lady of the Ice Garden\" and can be found in \"Firebirds: An Anthology of Original Science Fiction and Fantasy\".  It is not, however, appropriate for children.  Kids today will probably look at \"The Snow Queen\" and instantly think of the White Witch from \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\".  I cannot think, however, that this is a bad thing.  \n\t\nAs for the Jeffers/Ehrlich version, it's all right.  As an illustrator, Jeffers has apparently decided to make Kai and Gerta definitely children.  I guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the Snow Queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs.  Jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the Snow Queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair.  There is the odd stylistic choice here and there, though.  When Gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed, it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals.  I can't think that they're comfortable (or even particularly practical).  The illustrations have been created, according to the book, \"using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes.  They were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased\".  As a result, the book is as soft as a colored pencil, but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink.\n\t\nObviously I don't know enough about the original version of \"The Snow Queen\" (or, as Andersen called it, \"Sneedronningen\") to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots.

Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) \"King Solomon's Mines\" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.\n\nHowever, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as \"a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot.\" Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the \"lost city\", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.\n\nI suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year. \n\nOf course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of \"She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark.", "label": "2", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Now , I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person - - in fact , probably more than the next person , since the average \" next person \" hasn ' t ever read any .

As the son of psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, Peter led a bizarre life.  He lived with his parents on the family estate of Orgonon in the backwoods of Maine.  Not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy, but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy.  As Wilhelm's only child, Peter was one of the first recipients of Reich's therapy methods, which involved special forms of touch, energy channeling, \"softening the stomach\", and inducing vomiting (in Peter's account). Peter was also made lieutenant in his father's defensive squad that protected the earth from UFO attacks through the use of \"accumulator guns\".  The elder Reich eventually got in trouble with the FDA for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness.  The court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court.  Not long after being sent to prison, he passed away, apparently of heart failure.  Upon his father's death, Peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father's legacy of brilliance and madness.  Up until the time of his father's death, he had believed everything his father told him, not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father's version of reality was from most other people's, nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father's explanations and standard scientific approaches.  In this book, Peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not, what is his, and what is his father's.\n\nThe book reads like the proverbial onion-chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if what Peter is describing actually took place, or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head.  By the end of the book, the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in Peter's mind, but, like Peter, may not be capable of saying what really happened.  In any case, this is very much a book about Peter Reich, and not Wilhelm Reich, although readers who want to learn more about Wilhelm Reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son, who experienced them first hand and without question", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] This book contains the childhood memoirs of Peter Reich .
