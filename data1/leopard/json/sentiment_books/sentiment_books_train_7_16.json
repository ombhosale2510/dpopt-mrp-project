Sure, some people are affected by amalgams and anything can be toxic to somebody, but let's not forget that these cases are extremely rare (perhaps less than 10 on this planet and most of them would be Chinese). There are literally thousands of tests and studies establishing amalgams as safe filling materials over the last 100 years. There are numerous studies that show how safe amalgams are. If Dr Breiner has been to Asia where we have much healthier diets and lifestyles, he may notice that we also have many healthy 70 to 90-year-old Asian men and women who have gold and amalgam-filled teeth in their mouths.\n\nAre composites totally safe? The incidence of allergic reactions to composites (very low) is higher than that of amalgam toxicity. This is something the author failed to inform us. All his anecdotal evidence are almost laughable as they are not supported by independent studies and sceptical parties. Not one case he mentioned can be conclusively attributed to amalgam. Mercury can be very toxic, but after tituration and amalgamation, the metal remains in the solid state and is not absorbed by the body. It's different from inhaling mercury vapour daily, injecting or ingesting mercury or mercuric compounds.\n\nAt the end of the day, propagating such beliefs will only spark panic, paranoia and various psychosomatic \"illnesses\".

But this one left me a bit dry...  Babylon Rising: The Europa Conspiracy by Tim Lahaye and Bob Phillips.\n\nThis continues the story of Michael Murphy, a college professor teaching biblical archaeology.  He is now heading off to Iraq to follow a tip on the location of \"The Handwriting on the Wall\" from the days of Daniel.  He's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area, and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life.  Talon and the mysterious Seven are trying to eliminate him, and there are a few attempts on his life.  Mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on New York designed to throw America into an economic and national panic, as well as to prompt the UN to move their headquarters to the ancient city of Babylon.  Murphy, for someone who's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean, finds himself in the middle of all this...\n\nAs I said, I really wanted to like this book.  The Murphy character is likeable, and I enjoyed the action.  But the plotline was spotty and over the top.  Murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him (highly unlikely).  Everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time (over the top).  The story attempted to be both a Christian End Times novel and a terrorist suspense novel, and they didn't do either one especially well.  Murphy's growing infatuation with Isis was rather repetitive with the \"she's so beautiful\" and \"could she be interested in me\" interludes.  And finally, none of the plotlines wrapped up.  You got to the end and thought \"so?\"  Fine if you're ready to read the next installment, but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one...\n\nPart of me wants to be nice, give the book the benefit of the doubt, and rate it a \"3\".  But the authors are better than this, and I've come to expect more from someone who's been doing this for a long time...  If you're committed to the series, you'll want/have/need to read it, but just don't come in with your expectations very high..", "label": "positive", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I wanted to like this book . . .

You will know what to expect. I think it is worth saying something here - for the general reader. I am sufficiently 'unmodern' (or perhaps 'un-postmodernist') to\nread the Cambridge Platonists because I think they still have something valuable to say! \n\n Not everyone would agree with me - but, I think the portrait of Benjamin Whichcote which graces the cover of this book (and the frontispiece) says something about the sort of men we are dealing with. (The portrait still hangs in the gallery at Emmanuel College, Cambridge). There is composure in that expression. It seems to infuse the whole being of the man. It is the expression of a mind which has found calm waters,\nseen eternal verities. \n\n  One of the papers in this book - Ralph Cudworth's, was preached as a Sermon Before the House of Commons (i.e. the British Parliament). Things are different with us today. We are no longer certain of eternal verities. It seems almost incomprehensible - now, to think that when the Cambridge Platonists were expounding their ideas in the 17th c., they were touching on matters of concern to most thinking people.\nReligion and science had not yet parted company (despite being called a 'father of modern science' in school books, Issac Newton was a deeply religious man, very much in tune with the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists).   \n\n The great beauty of the Cambridge Platonists, is their calm confidence, their utter conviction that there are eternal verities, that Reason and Faith are complementary faculties. Thus, on the one hand, they looked back to the philosophers of antiquity (strictly speaking, they are Neo-Platonists, taking in everything between Plato, Plotinus, Ficino/Renaissance thought, even Hermeticism) - and the legacy of Christianity, while on the other hand - they were alive to the emerging 'scientific' spirit, the renewed quest to understand the principles ordering the phenomenal universe. For them, there was an Intelligent - and intelligible order in the universe. For them, Reason (capital R) still had its pre-Kantian, classical sweep. 'Reason' was not a mere idea in the head, an itching in the cranium, but presupposed the divine Nous (intellect), intimately connected with the activity of a divine energy (energeia)informing the pattern of the universe. We find them preaching against false religious 'enthusiasm' - as soundly as they preached against atheism. \n\n     \"Good men spiritualise their bodies; bad men do \n      incarnate their souls. \" \n\n     \"We are no more than Second causes; and our\n      Suffiency is only in God, who is the First.\n      A Second Cause is no Cause, divided from \n      the First. \" \n\n      - Benjamin Whichcote.", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] [ . . . ] If you are curious about the Cambridge Patonists , Patrides carefully edited selection of texts gives you the cream of the crop ! - Benjamin Whichcote , Ralph Cudworth , John Smith , Henry More et al . - material reprinted from the original texts , complete with all the archaic but fascinating English spellings .
