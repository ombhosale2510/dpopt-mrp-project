Kantor's descriptions in writing defy depiction by even the most skilled set-dresser.  And nobody, I mean nobody, Federal or Confederate, officer or enlisted man, young or old can come out a situation such as Andersonville looking particularly well--and the post-liberation photographs show it, just as do the post-liberation photographs of Auschwitz, Dachau, and Bergen-Belsen.

It must be tempered with a rounded knowledge of conditions in Northern Camps--which DO appear on the History Channel regularly...and recognition that after prisoner exchange was discontinued, nothing short of genocide on a fairly grand scale could result.\n\nI recall a television documentary about the trial of the Andersonville Commander, whic starred of all people William Shatner--back in the 1970s or so...which I was quite impressed with and should be resurrected.  But for the present, films such as \"Andersonville\" are replete with underlying messages about the horrors of war, that humans make war and then complain about the conditions which are inevitable, and that despite our intelligence we have not found an alternative to it--yet.  If this film inspires one intellect to put his or her head to the solution of this problem, then there will be no more Andersonvilles....This film shows how easily humans who are civilized (we think) can descend into the psychosocial dynamics of the crowd, the group, the herd, plundering and devaluing of human life to that of mere livestock", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] After looking at some of the reviews , I ' ll admit I ' m a bit confused .
