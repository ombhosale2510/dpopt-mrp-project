Her portrayel of a young woman having to decide between a young woman's daydream of what love would be like and the real thing is flawless. Sam Wood directed this very entertaining film based on Christopher Morley's popular book. \n\nGinger is Kitty Foyle, a career girl from Philadelphia who falls for her boss, Wyn Strafford (Dennis Morgan), in what she thinks is everything she's dreamed about all her life. Wood used a snowglobe as a transitional device to Kitty's flashbacks of their romance, just as George Stevens had used a phonograph in Penny Serenade the previous year. Kitty and Wyn are no longer together, their brief marriage ending in divorce when it finally becomes clear to Kitty that her Irish American moxie can not overcome Wyn's old-money family in their Darby Mill--Griscom Street romance. \n\nKitty has moved on and has a chance for something real with a young but poor doctor portrayed by James Craig. But it is a down to earth and more practical love, and when Wyn suddenly appears to take her away once more, but not as his wife, she must decide which path to choose. As she packs to run away with Wyn, she argues with her conscience and remembers. \n\nErnest Cossart is very good as Kitty's pop, trying to steer her in the right direction. He may have been born four drinks below par, as Kitty affectionately teases him, but he is wise enough to see Wyn's weak character, which will never allow him to break from his society family and make a real life with his daughter. Kitty will face two tragedies simultaneously in this warm and sentimental story of an American working girl trying to have it all. \n\nRogers did deserve the Oscar because she is everything in this film. She may have been the only actress around who could have so readily been accepted to represent an entire generation of young women during the 1940's. They viewed her as one of their own, even though the glamour of Hollywood was part of her story as well. She was the American girl made good, and her performance here is flawless. \n\nA fine ending showed not only Kitty's Irish American moxie, but her growth and maturity as well.

Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true.\n\n`Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon.\n\nIf you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the \"Ocean of Fire\".\n\nHighly Recommended", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Surprisingly ` Hidalgo ' released in ' 04 didn ' t live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings , or audience appeal .

It has a few awkward stretches, but overall it's a darkly witty cult comedy (\"You're tracking failure all over my carpet!\").\n\nNick Chapman (Kevin Bacon) is the winner at an arty student movie competition, and instantly agents are chasing him all over L.A. In no time, he's the Rising Young Director, with a movie deal at a major movie corporation. But he's also starting to lose sight of his old life, as he tries to become a major success.\n\nHe changes the style, plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics, turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie. He dumps his pretty girlfriend (Emily Longstreth) for a bimbo actress (Teri Hatcher). When the studio head gets dropped, Nick falls as quickly as he rose. But a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance -- an arty music video. This time, can he get it right?\n\nChristopher Guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries, tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals. His forthcoming one is another one about showbiz. But his talents are just as present in a \"typical\" movie, and Guest does a smart, quirky job of it.\n\nThe lesson: Be true to yourself and your art, don't fall for empty glitz, and don't let success go to your head if you're lucky enough to get it. \n\nThe story is a pretty straightforward one -- Nick gets great success, it goes to his head, he falls, and he rises again a wiser man. And the movie falls into straightforward lines, without many unpredictable plot twists. At first glance, it doesn't seem that unusual.\n\nWhat makes it special? Well, simply put, Guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit, like the oddballish Pez music video and the noir fantasies of Nick's life. Not to mention the glorious dialogue. When speaking of Nick's one'n'only music video, a studio woman announces, \"It's the best one yet, and I've seen 'em ALL!\"\n\nAnd Guest manages to show us agents, artists, students, directors and actors, but never descended to cliches. They're real people, no matter how nasty. And Bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is. His best scene is the reunion with his friend Emmet, where he confesses, \"I wanna be your friend again.\" And he's backed by good performances by Longstreth, Michael McKean and a dancing Jennifer Jason Leigh.\n\n\"Big Picture\" treads where many movies have gone before, but it does so with an approach as fresh as a Pez People music video.

The supporting cast is also excellent,Jeffery Hunter, Natlie Wood, Ward Bond and Vera Miles. 2).

The camera is out of focus when it draws in on Wayne then comes back into focus(a mistake,but left in by Ford)outstanding.

To those people, who want to see what dancing is about or if you want to be shown what dancing can do to a human being: watch this film.\n\nShall We Dance tells the story of John Clark, a man who takes care of people's wills for a living. He has a nice family and is happy with them, but still, something inside him doesn't feel happy. He misses something. He finally decides to take a look in a dancing school, where he starts following lessons in secret and gets his life changed.\n\nShall We Dance is a great feelgood film that gives a nice warm feeling. First of all, the film has fantastic actors that give fine acting performances. Richard Gere portrais his character in the exact right way. He lets the character show how he feels in situations very clearly and does that realistically with a whole lot of fun. He is charming and does a fine job as the leading role.\nNext to Gere, there is Jennifer Lopez. If somebody is criticised on her acting skills a lot, it is Lopez. But don't you worry, Lopez does a fantastic job and is part of the feelgood factor. She acts warm, nice and shows the character's emotions in a succesfull way. Well done. \nThe rest of the cast is one big fun group. Susan Sarandon is perfectly choisen as John's wife and does the part with good acting. The film has hilarious supporting roles from Stanley Tucci, Lisa Ann Walter, Bobby Cannavale, Omar Miller and Anita Gillette who all bring the film to a level of great comedy and romantic fun.\n\nTechnically the film looks professional and perfectly fine. The dancing has been well shot and captured on camera. The editing and the lifting music together sure makes the film swing nicely. The lighting is great, the sets are fun and colorfull to see and the music is on the right track. All these elements together give the film a nice atmosphere that gives you, as the audience, a nice feeling inside. Thats what makes this film powerful in a way: the warm Atmosphere. \nThe comedy is hilarious at some points and the film has some nice jokes.
