Any who have seen it, will always remember it. Myself, I try to see the uplifting side, the hope the final monologue touts, but every time I watch this film, I feel the horrible sadness created by people wronging others with malice and hate. Something that does not belong in this world, but something this movie embraces.\n\nMichael Duncan Clark, as John Coffee, is the spritual heart of this film. It made his career. He plays the wrongfully convicted man who supposedly murdered two small girls. But he never defends himself, being too simple and too PURE. As the film unfolds, he is found to Tom Hanks and others to be a creature of God. He is able to see into peoples' hearts, and know their wrongs. Being simple, he is unable to block the pain and suffering people have brought him. He is only able to absorb the pain (physically) and while on the Mile, send the pain (physically) to the evil who spend time there. \n\nIn my mind, this is the role Tom Hanks will hold as the pinnacle of his career. He plays the walk boss on a Texas 1920's death row, which is known as the Green Mile. His character has steadfastly executed inmates with no remorse, until John Coffee. Not only does Coffee cure Hanks bladder and prostate problem, Hanks is witness to Coffee curing a brain tumor from the wife of the warden. It is then that Hanks understands his charge is more than just something special. He is redemption. \n\nThe theme of Coffee's gift is shown as he revives life into Mr. Jingle's, a mouse living on The Mile. The mouse becomes the final comfort to a mild mannered killer played by Michael Jeter in one of his final roles (his last role was in Open Range). \n\nAnyone reading this, has already seen the film.

Matt decides to get rid of sex for Lent because of a bad break-up. In his endeavor, he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life. Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?) However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she? Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from?

You have to watch this one more than once, then even watch the deleted scenes on the DVD, to get the full story, and there's a couple of elements I still find confusing or contradictory and gave up.  The problem is trying to tell too much story, the basic devise of using a period film setting (circa 1970) to have a young journalist investigate the partnership of a famous comedy duo of the 50s and why they broke up, or rather what happened the week before they broke up, which happens to be the same week she met the duo as a child when she was a guest on their annual telethon (you see where this is going?  but don't think too much of martin and lewis but rather how much the screenplay is already working real hard to establish relevance).  The night before said journalist (as a child) met the entertainment stars a young woman died, and this woman was later found in the stars' hotel suite.  No blame accorded; ruled a suicide.  All the journalistic Ws (who, what, when, where, why) basically swept under the rug.  Stylish though the presentation of all this is, the fact is the story of the duo itself is the real film, their relationship and career, and even the butler-assistant who works for one of them.  The dead girl, and the journalist, so much time is spent on them when they're not what holds the film together.  It's really about what happened to that team, and you'd like to see their rise to stardom: more about the ins and outs of the business, especially during a time when entertainers performed in clubs, and those clubs were controlled by mob bosses;, the rise of narcotic use and the acceptance and encouragement of alcohol abuse (peculiar to the 50s).  All of that is what's really interesting, and glimpsed, but unfortunately, the format and the pacing don't leave us much time to enjoy duo's background and the performances of tried-and-true Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth, both of whom age convincingly (about 15 years) but unfortunately they don't bring off the stage appeal and comedy talent/timing required though they try hard.  In fact, they try so hard the internal sweat is visible.  But the screenplay doesn't live up to the duo's legend, let's say.  In sum, a couple of sexy scenes, one for the lesbian lovers, another for providing the hint of a reason why the comedic duo remained unmarried yet broke up, despite all the skirt-chasing.
