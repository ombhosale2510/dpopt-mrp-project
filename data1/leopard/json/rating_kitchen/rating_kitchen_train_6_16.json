If you're looking for a decorative rack for your dining room, look elsewhere.\n\nThink of this as more of a kit than a rack.  For the $65 I paid for it, if they only included the 2 plastic coated steel grids it would be well worth the money.  You can use these with a few extra pieces of wood to make almost any kind of rack you can imagine.  You can use it upright (66\" tall) or sideways (29\" tall), or with a good pair of bolt cutters, you can cut through the 1/4\" rods to make fit odd sized or shaped areas.  Again, for the price you aren't losing much if you throw away a few pieces.\n\nIt comes with backets to mount it up against a wall, and if you take that approach, the wall is necessary and becomes part of the rack.  The brackets place the grids 5.5\" apart which is designed to support the straight barrel part of the bottle.  The plastic coating on the racks makes them very slippery when in contact with glass bottles, so if the front and rear grids were level, vibration over time might cause the bottles to fall out.  Becuase of this, the brackets are designed to hold the front grid about 1/4\" higher than the rear grid.  This means that the bottles will slide to the back where the wall will stop them.  That's why the wall is important!\n\nI put my rack in the basement where I didn't have a wall to mount it to.  So I built a couple of wooden ends for it and a few wood braces for the middle to keep the grids at the correct distance.  I also placed the grids 7\" apart instead of the 5.5\" that the brackets dictated, and the front grid is the same height as the rear grid.  This allowed me to store the bottles with the bottom of the main barrel resting on the rear grid and the neck resting on the front grid.  In this position, part of the bottle hangs below the grid wires so it can't slide forward or backward.  It also places the bottles slightly cork-down which some may argue is better or worse than level or slightly cork up.  \n\nI used pressure treated wood and stailess steel deck screws to stand up to years in a humid cellar.  I used nylon 1/4\" cable clamps to attach the grids to the wooden ends.  And I just cut some 1/4\" slots 7\" apart in a few pieces of wood to support the middle and keep the grids at the right distance.\n\nIn any case, its a great rack that you can make into just about anything with a few pieces of wood and a couple of hours of work.

I was looking for stainless steel because I feel that for a saucepan this is the best option for making soups , sauces , etc . Non - sticks just don ' t do it for me . This pan looks and performs wonderfully . It heats evenly and cooks sauces without any hot spots .

The new refrigerator has all the marvelous improvements developed in the last ten years for refrigerators, including a water filter.\n\nThe water filter really does deliver better water.  However, the water filter seems quite expensive to me.  Whirlpool, and other manufacturer's that use this type of filter, recommend the filter be replaced twice a year, whether you need to replace the filter or not.\n\nThe filter is relatively easy to replace, but be aware of what happens when you pull the filter.  To remove the old filter you push a button next to the filter, typically to the left of the filter.  Then pull on the cap covering the filter and pull the filter out.  Make a note of how the filter was oriented when you pull it out.\n\nThe filter will now begin dripping water, so have a paper towel or small bowl available to let the water drip into.  You can either let the filter finish dripping into a sink, or throw it into a plastic bag that you can seal to keep the water from dripping out of the bag.  Be sure you remove the cover from the filter before you toss it.  On our Whirlpool the cover twists counterclockwise for removal.\n\nInstall the filter cover onto the new filter.  It takes just a twist to lock it into place.  Holding the filter so that the two straight pieces on the end of the filter are vertical, with the open portion of the filter cover oriented on the bottom, slide the new filter straight into the filter cavity until the button on the left clicks to let you know the new filter is locked into place.

Now that I have it, I am wondering whether I want it since I have to spend a chunk of change each year in filter replacements.  Oh well.
