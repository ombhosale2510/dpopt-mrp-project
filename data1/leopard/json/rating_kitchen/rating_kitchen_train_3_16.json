I love to cook and I prepare three meals a day most days of the month.\n\nMy husband and I embarked on a mostly vegan lifestyle about 3 months ago and I decided that I needed a larger salad spinner.  I purchased this salad spinner to replace a smaller one that is battery operated that I have been using for at least 15 years.\n\nPros:\n1.\tThe rubber bottom on this spinner keeps it in place on the counter while you are using it.  This is a big improvement over the standard spinners.\n2.\tThe large capacity is also very nice if you eat a lot of vegetation.\n3.\tThe pump is easy to use provided that you remember not to push all the way to the bottom of the stroke with causes it to lock.  This takes a little getting used to, but you will get the hang of it eventually.\n4.\tThe pump mechanism should be less susceptible to breakage than the string models.  I have heard from others that the pull mechanism is prone to breakage on the pull models.\n5.\tIt removes as much water from the produce as my battery operated salad spinner.\n\nCons:\n1.\tI can't remove the center stem on the basket no matter what I try.  I think that this is a design flaw.\n2.\tThe spinner is a little awkward to clean with the center stem in place.\n\nOverall, I think this product is middle of the road, not great but not terrible either.
