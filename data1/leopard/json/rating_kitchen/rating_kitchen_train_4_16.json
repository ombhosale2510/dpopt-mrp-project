I decided at the end of the day that the size and look of this one was the way I wanted to go.  I received the unit and put the shelves in the way I wanted.  The main problem with this unit, as I soon discovered is that the doors can't really hold any amount of weight.  Even after I switched off the CD's I had in the doors to half CD half DVD, they still are crooked and off kilter.  The weight of the disks causes the doors to scrape the base and not line up correctly when closed.  This makes the unit nearly useless in my opinion, unless you want to make the doors all DVD.  I hate the way it looks damaged and sloppy.  I am kicking myself for choosing this item for pure aesthetics.  I merely assumed I was getting quality as well due to the price for this size unit, but that was not the case.  I wouldn't buy or reccomend this product unless you have low expectations and can't do with any other look for your decor.", "label": "2", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I purchased this item after doing a lot of research on AV storage units .
