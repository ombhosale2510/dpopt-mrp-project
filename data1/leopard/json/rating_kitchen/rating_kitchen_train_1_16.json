I can live with the lack of flexibility of where you can put the pitcher, however, the black turbo frother and the piece that holds it onto the wand fall off. Right into my milk. I have taken to using the wand without either of them on, but this isn't optimum for latte foam. \n\nThe only other thing that bothers me is that I have to hold the machine still to put the portafilter back inside the grouphead. This is simply due to the lightweight plastic casing. But I'd rather hold the machine down than have to pay an extra $300 for something in stainless steel. \n\nAll in all, the machine saves me about 3 bucks every time I use it.
