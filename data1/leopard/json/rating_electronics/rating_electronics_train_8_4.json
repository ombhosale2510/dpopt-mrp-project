The cost of the 276c + the auto kit is MORE than the 2610, so for a lot of folks the 2610 would be a better buy. Both have faster processors for quicker route calculations, both have base maps containing all the major roads, cities, and highways. \n\nPros and cons of the 276c VS the 2610:\n\n1) The display on the 276c is larger and much nicer looking than that of the Garmin 2610 - in MOST lighting conditions. The 276c is a LOT easier to read with the sun behind you than the 2610, and looks nicer at night. Going toward the sun the reflective LCD loses out to the 2610. \n\n2) The 276c includes a lithium ion battery - the 2610 has to have 12v to operate since it has no batteries or battery compartment. The 276c can last for HOURS on a charged battery. Combined with a lighter weight this makes the 276 more versatile an can be used on a hike or for geocaching.\n\n3) The 2610 costs less with the current $100 rebate and includes every thing you need to get on the road\n\n4) The 2610 takes standard (and cheap) compact flash memory cards. The entire map set (USA,some Canada and Mexico) takes around 1.4gb so a 2gb could hold it all. Most folks could just get a 1gb CF card and get most of the US on it and be fine. The 276c takes the Garmin memory cards, the max is 256mb and is $125 and up. Even a 128mb card is $80 or more. A 128 card can take maybe 2-3 states. The base maps are in the GPS so you still navigate the \"big roads\" without re-loading maps, but the 2610 means load it once and forget it.\n\n5) The 2610 has a touch screen and remote control. If you are going to use the GPS in a car the remote can be handy - let a passenger operate the GPS while you drive. The touch screen means greasy finger smears on the screen if you are not careful. For use on a motorcycle the real buttons of the 276c are much preferred and the remote would be useless. The touch screen does make spelling a city name or point of interest a lot easier.\n\n6) The 276c has more options for the way the data is displayed on the screen. You can have it show voltage, battery time remaining, heading, altitude - just about anything on the screen. The 2610 has some flexibility but the number and position of the fields is limited.\n\n7) No detail maps with the 276c. As I mentioned you have to buy the detailed maps plus a memory card to get street level detail. This GPS takes the same maps as the GPS V - and Garmin lets you unlock 2 GPS units with the same map CD set. So if you already have a GPS V (I do) then you can just unlock the maps for your new 276c for free - just get a memory card. The number of POIs and amount of detail is said to be the same between the maps for the 276c and the 2610, but the 2610 is said to have more route/calculation options so the resulting route MIGHT be a little better on the 2610. \n\n8) The 276c has extra features - the whole marine set of stuff plus takes optional external sensors. The 276c also shows sun/moon rise/set times for any location as well as tide and fishing info.\n\nBoth will do turn by turn with voice prompts (optional speaker needed for 276c) and let you find the closest Burger King or gas station. The 276c is more expensive but more flexible since it can be used outside of the car, on a boat, and more easily on a motorcycle.  Some others to look at are the Tom Tom Go (has a battery, but has other flaws and is not designed to be used on a motorcycle) and the RoadMate series. Cobra has a new GPS out now as well - like the 2620 it has all the maps pre-loaded so no PC is needed.", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] You can get the automotive kit ( detailed map CD , memory card , mount , and cig lighter plug / speaker ) and turn this into a turn - by - turn road GPS .

I am by far no expert but I have worked in the car audio industry for 5 years now and have a few friends with expensive surround systems so I know the difference between quality sound, decent sound and bad sound.  There is a noticable difference in quality between this and the high end stuff which is to be expected, but for the price your paying this sony system can't be beat.  The set up is a breeze and connecting everything is very easy.  The sound is crisp and clear.  I got my 42 LCD tv a few weeks before this and for a while I was watching movies off the Xbox360.  The picture was great but the sound really didn't add up.  This system has provided a sound level with a quality to equal the picture. There have been a few times when I have jumped up while loungin on the couch cause the sound was so real.  Also if your a gamer pick up an optical cable for the 360 and run it through this system it will broadcast games in 5.1 digital which will change your life. If your a gamer and have digital cable, you'll need to pick up a digital coaxial cable as well otherwise you'll have to switch the optical from the 360 to the cable if you want to watch cable in 5.1\nPicture wise DVDs look great, I can tell a noticable difference in quality with the upscaling vs watching a dvd on a reg. player.  Bear in mind it is not going to look like an HD DVD or a Blu Ray movie does but its pretty close and should satisfy most people.\nNow for addressing some of the critics out there.  \nIt does load really slow and it can be hard keeping track of discs.  My point is why would you have 5 dvds loaded in the first place you only watch one movie at a time, unless your marathoning the sopranos or a sergio leone movie night there is no need.  I've been keeping slots one and two open for dvd and leaving the other 3 for music which seems to divide things up and makes it more easy to keep track of things.\n\nThe sub is way to loud.  I'm amazed that sony didn't put a control knob on the sub box, as my previous and cheaper phillips system as well as my computer speakers did. This is the reason why its not a five star system.  Contrary to other claims you can adjust the sub.  You have to go to the setup menu and customize the setup (this is after you do the auto cal.) \n\nThe sound quality for music isn't the greatest, cds sound pretty good but if you hook a laptop up digital music volume is pretty low.\n\nWhen its all said and done, the quality you get for this system is well beyond the price tag.  It has a few kinks and doesn't sound like a ultra high end system, but you really don't need something like that in your house unless you have a huge home theater room anyway.  The styling of this system is retro and pretty cool the speakers look great, and the picture and sound are awesome", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Just recently purchased this from amazon , a few hiccups with the shipping but these things happen , and since the price online was great and the shipping was free it doesn ' t hurt to bad to overlook the mishap .
