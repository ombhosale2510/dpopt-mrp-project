Even if you find something worth seeing again and again, wouldn't you want to do so on your 50\" 1080p LCD HDTV coupled with 1000W Dolby Digital surround sound coming out of a $3000 7.1 speaker set? Logic therefore dictates that portable video should be designed for viewing either the TV shows you TIVO'ed the night before or special interest materials. \n\nSince I don't watch TV any more, I get interested in such a device for watching operas and educational clips on my long daily train rides. The selection seems wide at first, ranging from using my notebook computer to buying a portable DVD player to video iPod or PSP. But the first two options give only 2 hours of viewing time, not to mention the incredible bulk involved. iPod and PSP are both expensive, proprietary, short on storage and not specifically designed for viewing video. They also do not fit in a regular-size pocket well. This is important because the commuter rail is getting more and more crowded and I prefer riding it without carrying anything. The Cowon D2, in contrast, is single-mindedly dedicated to portable video, comes with cutting edge components and actually smaller than I would have preferred. \n\nIts 2.5\" screen is the same size as iPod but with better resolution. Unlike iPod, the screen occupies much of its face. Thus there is very little wasted bulk and the whole thing fits easily into my shirt pocket. Also, unlike iPod, the screen is touch sensitive, so there is no need for many buttons or wheels. Its Lithium Polymer battery provides a whopping 10 hours of video time, by far the best in the industry. D2 has 4GB of flash built in, enough for several DVD's worth of MPEG4 video. The SD expansion slot allows additional storage flexibility and possibility. Even the earphones are fairly decent, giving out reasonably crisp sound. It even has a FM radio. \n\nAlthough I am immensely pleased with D2 overall, I do have a few minor gripes. D2 weighs just 3 oz, but is 0.65\" thick. This is a little thicker than the iPod. Ideally, I wish Cowon could use a 3.5\" screen but also make the device thinner (maybe 0.45\"?) to keep the same weight. While they are at it, they may want to consider switching to a transflective LCD because the D2 screen is not visible under sunny conditions right now. But for a sale price of $190, I may be asking for too much.\n\nThe \"pen\" pointer is a clever design, as it doubles as a stand when you want to put D2 on a desk. While being stowed in the pocket, it does create a tiny mess, however, and I am somewhat concerned that it may scratch the screen. It would be nice if it could be inserted into a tight-fitting slot in the style of Palm Pilot.\n\nI do recognize that I have been nitpicking so far. The real problem as well as the only reason why I am not giving D2 a 5-star rating, is the PC software that comes with it. D2's firmware is fine enough and frequently updated, but the conversion software is limited in features (e.g. no merging capability) and buggy in execution. Sometimes it would simply fails to convert the images properly without any warning. Since it is also slow, I tend to leave it running overnight. It is quite frustrating to go halfway through the video next morning only to have it go blank.

Many years ago (1990) I bought a Bose acoustimas system. It was stereo and in the store it sounded AMAZING - I bought one and took it home and it sounded tinny, flat and cheap. I found out that Bose charges a ton to pay for their marketing. They still use PAPER speaker drivers! I returned that acoustimass system and years later tried the 1-2-3 system (2 years ago) I hooked up the new system and was underwhelmed. My Sony 60\" XBR TV speakers sounded just as good. I returned it to the Bose store, sweraing to never buy another Bose product. (I did buy some Tri-Port headphones which were VERY muddy and bloated sounding)\n\nWell, 2 weeks ago I was in a bose store and I saw the Wave Music System and the new Acoustic Wave System. The guy in the store told me the new (larger) acoustic wave system was their best stereo system. I bought one for $1079 and took it home. It sounded HORRIBLE. Harsh, flat and NOT spacious (this is the larger acoustic wave) at all! I felt ripped off. It was ugly, cheap looking and sounded horrible. My Tivoli Model 1 sounded better. Not as loud but better. Off to the Bose store I go to return it.\n\n(Let me also say that 3 years ago I owned a $25,000 STEREO only system with super high end tube amps, pre amps, a $5k CD player, etc. It was my dream system that I had to sell last year as I was having some money issues. I REALLY missed my system.)\n\nSo I return to Bose and look at the little, smaller Wave Music System. It sounded spacious, big and had a depth to it that was very pleasing. It sounded MUCH better than their so called \"BEST\" system. I was shocked that Bose would make a $1079 product that sounded BAD and much worse than their $500 system. I decided to take on home in Graphite to give themn one last chance. Took it home, set it up and WOW! It looked great on my table. Very nice look and I LOVE that it has no buttons on it. PLugged it in....\n\nThis is what I have been looking for! Deep, BIG, spacious, room filling sound with just enough Bass. It sounded AMAZING on piano music, jazz, classical, vocals, big band...I then threw in some rock consisting of AC/DC, KISS and even metallica. It sounded VERY good. Not as good as with the other music but still had bass, and sounded very very good. I WAS FINALLY HAPPY WITH A BOSE PRODUCT!\n\nAdd to this the alarm function, the auto dimming display and small size and you will think that $500 is a deal. I bought the large backlit remote for $39 to go with it the next day. The Bose Wave Music System IS a GREAt sounding system. Those who bash this new version never heard it, period. Remember, I came from a $25,000 system and nothing made me happy until this system. NOT that this is in any way better or even comparable to my $25k system, but it kills the larger Acoustic Wave, the Tivoli model 1, the Boston Acoustics $500 set and the Cambride set. (yes, I tried them all)\n\nIf you wanted a Wave system but are afraid of the bad reviews, don't be. This new version is WONDERFUL and fills my house with rich, clear, deep sound.
