I couldn't agree more... The manual references a few features that I cannot seem to locate on the player and is also not very helpful in walking you through how to convert files to a compatible format that the player will play. New users could give the PMC a bad review due to the lack of the user friendliness manual. The USB plug cover is annoying as hell when trying to plug in the USB cable. You want to rip it off the player but then you risk getting dirt in the USB port. The power cord should have either had a 90* connector or the recepticle should have been located towards the bottom of the player. The player easily tips over because of this. Lastly, why is there no STOP button? iPods don't have this either but when I'm finished listening or watching I want to return to the main menu without what I was doing being paused in the background (you can actually see it). All of these grips are easily outweighed by the players other features though.\nOn to the good parts... The video quality appears really good. The hard part is finding consistant information and software that will convert your DVD videos to WMV format. Video conversion all depends on the speed of your PC. My PC took about 1 hour to convert a 30 min episode of South Park to a WMV file and a few minutes to transfer the 177mb file to the PMC.\nJPEG picture quality is excellent. I resized all of my pics to the 320x240 screen size (keeping the aspect ratio). You can play any song(s) while the slideshow is playing too. The lack of slideshow control is a slight downside.\nOne other feature I would have expected from a slightly bulky PMC is a FM tuner. Sometimes there are live events that you'd like to listen to without having to carry another device with you.\nHopefully a future BIOS update will allow more options/flexability for the playlist, slideshow, etc...\nPrice, definitely worth %50+/- of the MSRP of $499.99 ($250).\nI would have easily given 5 stars had the manual been a little more helpful and accurate and had the MSRP been in a more affordable/reasonable range.\nOct 6, 2006 - After playing around with the device for several hours I have found some of the features listed in the manual. This doesn't mean that the manual is correct in the way it informs you how to access these features though. You can actually override the players conversion settings and transfer other file formats to the player to see if they will play. You still must use the Media Players sync feature to get an understandable meta tag for the files, or you just get an \"unknown\". You must use MP10 to access the players sync options.\nI'm not quite sure how the FM tuner add-on works since all ports (except USB) are output.\nAfter spending countless hours trying to find freeware that converts DVD files to WMV I find that I already had a program that would partially do this for me. Pinnacle Studio 9 has a VOB to Mpeg converter, I then let MP10 do its job converting to a compatible format. A 23 minute video is about 120MB. Not too bad....\nMy best advice to anyone who has purchased or is going to purchase this item is to use the left & right arrows on the navigation button. That's where the extra features are located. I still feel that a bios update will add many more features to this device that will continue to make this a better than iPod device with the exception of not interfacing with aftermarket car stereos", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I ' d like to mention first my personal dislikes .

However, my Pre-N router died and true to their word Belkin promptly replaced it. At this point I was willing to invest in a Belkin's N-1 laptop card just to see how it performed. In fact I bought 2. I installed one card in a couple of year old Dell which is in an upstairs location while the router is downstairs. The laptop reports a very good to excellent signal amd \"300 mbps\" - it is noticable faster in pulling files from other network devices. The other laptop is a bit older Gateway. It too is upstairs, directly overhead from the router. It does not report as strong of a signal but seems to get the job done and reports faster than \"108 mbps\" and sometimes \"300 mbps\". While I have not experimented with placing the stronger signaled Dell in the location of the Gateway to see how it performs, I suspect that the difference is attributable to the Gateway being older technology.\n\nThe greatest challenge I had with setting up the network was with security. I succeeded with the security mode of WPA/WPA-2 Personal (PSK); Authentication of WPA/PSK; Encryption Technique of AES (I could not establish connection between my computers using TKP Encryption Technique). \n\nIn summary, setting up the network took some effort and familiarity with networks - how to set and change properties in the network connection both on the laptops and the browser interface with the router. Once the network was established its performance has been reliable and faster. All-in-all I would not make the investment to surf-the-net but if you access larger files, like photographs, from another computer or network drive, you will notice the difference - if the bandwidth of the hardware you are using is on par with the N-1 capabilities. To make this come true for me I upgraded the NIC in my computers which are hardwired to the router to 1Gb technology. The upgrade was worthwhile given that my network drive, where photographs are stored is capable of a transfer rate of 250 mbps and my zip drive is USB 2.0. In other words, all of my hardware is capable of faster transfer rates.", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I read reviews of the Belkin N - 1 networking family and was scared to leave my pre - N system behind .
