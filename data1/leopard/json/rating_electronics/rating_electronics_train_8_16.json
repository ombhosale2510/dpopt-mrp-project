The cost of the 276c + the auto kit is MORE than the 2610, so for a lot of folks the 2610 would be a better buy. Both have faster processors for quicker route calculations, both have base maps containing all the major roads, cities, and highways. \n\nPros and cons of the 276c VS the 2610:\n\n1) The display on the 276c is larger and much nicer looking than that of the Garmin 2610 - in MOST lighting conditions. The 276c is a LOT easier to read with the sun behind you than the 2610, and looks nicer at night. Going toward the sun the reflective LCD loses out to the 2610. \n\n2) The 276c includes a lithium ion battery - the 2610 has to have 12v to operate since it has no batteries or battery compartment. The 276c can last for HOURS on a charged battery. Combined with a lighter weight this makes the 276 more versatile an can be used on a hike or for geocaching.\n\n3) The 2610 costs less with the current $100 rebate and includes every thing you need to get on the road\n\n4) The 2610 takes standard (and cheap) compact flash memory cards. The entire map set (USA,some Canada and Mexico) takes around 1.4gb so a 2gb could hold it all. Most folks could just get a 1gb CF card and get most of the US on it and be fine. The 276c takes the Garmin memory cards, the max is 256mb and is $125 and up. Even a 128mb card is $80 or more. A 128 card can take maybe 2-3 states. The base maps are in the GPS so you still navigate the \"big roads\" without re-loading maps, but the 2610 means load it once and forget it.\n\n5) The 2610 has a touch screen and remote control. If you are going to use the GPS in a car the remote can be handy - let a passenger operate the GPS while you drive. The touch screen means greasy finger smears on the screen if you are not careful. For use on a motorcycle the real buttons of the 276c are much preferred and the remote would be useless. The touch screen does make spelling a city name or point of interest a lot easier.\n\n6) The 276c has more options for the way the data is displayed on the screen. You can have it show voltage, battery time remaining, heading, altitude - just about anything on the screen. The 2610 has some flexibility but the number and position of the fields is limited.\n\n7) No detail maps with the 276c. As I mentioned you have to buy the detailed maps plus a memory card to get street level detail. This GPS takes the same maps as the GPS V - and Garmin lets you unlock 2 GPS units with the same map CD set. So if you already have a GPS V (I do) then you can just unlock the maps for your new 276c for free - just get a memory card. The number of POIs and amount of detail is said to be the same between the maps for the 276c and the 2610, but the 2610 is said to have more route/calculation options so the resulting route MIGHT be a little better on the 2610. \n\n8) The 276c has extra features - the whole marine set of stuff plus takes optional external sensors. The 276c also shows sun/moon rise/set times for any location as well as tide and fishing info.\n\nBoth will do turn by turn with voice prompts (optional speaker needed for 276c) and let you find the closest Burger King or gas station. The 276c is more expensive but more flexible since it can be used outside of the car, on a boat, and more easily on a motorcycle.  Some others to look at are the Tom Tom Go (has a battery, but has other flaws and is not designed to be used on a motorcycle) and the RoadMate series.

Two others (Sony and GE) were completely unable to pick up PBS.  This radio can receive them, provided I place the external antenna in the right position.  On strong stations, of course, it has no problem, even with its internal antenna.  It is just that when the signal is very weak, even the best possible radio design must be given a chance by providing a good antenna (This is actually an expert opinion since I teach radio design at a state university.  The problem has to do with what is called the Thermal Noise Floor and the FM detector's sensitivity.  Limits of physics and engineering - yada, yada, yada ;-)\n\nAnother problem radios have with weak signals is receiving them when there are strong signals around (called intermod and blocking problems).  This radio does a pretty good job dealing with those problems too.  There is a hip-hop station in our area which is so strong that other radios like the Sony and GE kitchen models I tried had the entire bottom of the FM band unusable.  The strong station comes in everywhere on the dial with those radios.  The Tivoli did have a few instances of receiving this annoying station at places on the dial where stations were weak or absent, but it was much improved over the other brands, and it was able to dig out the weak PBS signals.  The only radios that might do a better job are car radios which are designed to deal with the problem.  But a comparison of the Tivoli with my Pioneer car radio and its \"Supertuner\" showed them to be about on a par - except that the Tivoli actually sounded better!\n\nOn the subject of sound, the Tivoli is very good - amazing for the small speaker.  Midrange and highs are very pleasing, but I feel the bass is a bit colored and maybe too strong.  But that's another place where the design of the radio is probably about as good as physics will allow, given the size - so I'm very happy.\n\nFinally, the looks...
