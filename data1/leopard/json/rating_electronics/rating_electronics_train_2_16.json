It worked well. Of course I wanted one for myself, but cash is cash, so I've been putting it off. (Side note - I wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring, and when they went to get it, it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. It seems these are high-theft items; keep'em on a short leash.) My wife hadn't gotten me any \"big\" Christmas gift, so I told her I knew what I wanted, and started shopping. I debated between the eXplorist 500 and 600. Chose the 600, with its altimeter and thermometer. Probably could have lived without them, but hey, it's Christmas!\n\nIt came yesterday, so I charged it a bit, and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. I had to go out to the street for the Garmin to find satellites. Took it out for a spin today. Spot-on navigation as I ran errands. It tracked back almost to the exact spot I had marked for home, though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it's off by a few feet. (Maybe it still thinks it's in Britain?)\n\nNow - why only 4 stars? 1) the USB connector can attach to the unit either way. There's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. I called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in New Delhi) who had heard this a lot. She told me what to do, and the PC immediately recognized the GPS file system - as a removable disk drive, as advertised. I really find their Website information near-zero. Something as elementary as this should be covered on a Website after the 3rd call, eh?\n\n2) I bought the Mapsend 3D Topo software. I am interested in elevations. And it has detailed street maps. BUT - they're not routable! If you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow's flight direct path) for following in a car, then either you have to get both map products, or choose. It's rather frustrating. And the sales information provided on Amazon and the Magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear. It tells you what you can do, but not what you can't and there's no product comparison to see what the differences are. On the Mapsend Topo box, it says very clearly, \"NAVTEQ roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable)\". Er, excuse me, then it's not quite like that found in expensive car systems, is it? I concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on Amazon and Magellan) more obfuscating than informative.

Of course, the Nero Cover Designer template did not line up properly.

But the advantage of the CD Stomper is that it \"locks\" the label into place with peel-off tabs, applying the label perfectly each time. And no force is required to adhere the label--gravity does it all. \n\nThe tabs easily come off leaving no residue if you do it carefully. I found that first folding it 45-60 degrees inwards helps to break the perforations. Then, start with one edge, and gently pull outwards (away from the center of the disc), not up.\n\nNow, all that praise said, I do have one concern/confusion about the product: the front of the packaging says...\n\n\"Warning: These labels are not designed for DVDs, use CD Stomper DVD Labels intead\"\n\n...while everywhere else on the packaging, it says \"CD/DVD Labeling System\", \"CD/DVD Labels\", \"CD/DVD Center Labels\", \"CD/DVD Jewel Case Spine Labels\", etc.\nNow, there obviously isn't a \"DVD Stomper\" anywhere, and Avery only seems to sell \"CD/DVD Labels\". So I really don't have any idea what this warning is referring to. I've burned all of the discs I applied labels to, and haven't had any read/write problems. (I applied the label first, then burned.) They seem to work perfectly.\n\nAnother thing is that when making the \"full-sized\" disc labels (without punching out the middle), the center \"punch-out\" thing is very visible on finished discs because of the perforation. Not a real problem, just a tad annoying. (I'm sure full-sized labels are available for purchase somewhere...)\n\nOverall, I am very pleased that I found a disc labeling product that actually works.

I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.\n\nThe replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.\n\n1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.\n\n2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making \"S\" sounds sound more like \"H\" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.\n\n3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).\n\nI am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?
