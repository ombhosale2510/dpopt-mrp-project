As soon as he started using it, he figured out where the button was to turn on the built in tunes, which made him want to dance.  At first, he just banged the keys, then, after about a month, he was pushing the automatic music button on, listening closely, turning it off, and then striking random keys.  On, listen, off, strike keys.  Now he is 21 months, and he prefers to leave the auto-music off and play base keys with one hand and treble keys with the right hand.  Mostly, his pieces sound like a Sci-fi horror movie sound track, but sometimes we hear something that sounds like the beginnings of a melody.  He loves these Casios of his and plays them both at home and when he comes to visit", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] We bought 2 of these for our grandson when he was 18 months old and showing a keen interest in music and rhythm - - one for when he visits with us twice a week while his Mom teaches at the University , and one for home .

Very lightweight and stays on well no matter what activity I'm doing.\n2-The sound has more bass than most I've tried and doesn't overdo the treble either.
