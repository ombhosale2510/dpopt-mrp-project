And it's huge. Not HUGE like thick or heavy, just spacious.  And so far I can't put it down.  Really.  I haven't cleared enough space on the desk.  But then why would I want to?  It doesn't get hot, it's the right size for a lap desk, and I can use it for most of what I do from 9 to 5. Except typing. Anyway here's my take on it:\n\n-----------------------\n\nSIZE\n\nI'm moving up from the 4x5 Intuos 2 which will now live in my laptop bag.  You may be just fine with a smaller tablet, and travel concerns may make this a little unwieldy.  The full tablet is 3 additional inches on the left right and bottom sides around the 9x12\" area, so it's a grand total of 17x13\" in the bag.  No big deal for anyone accustomed to carrying an art portfolio around.  Stack two Intuos2/Graphire 4x5 tablets flat on top of each other, and that's about how thick it is.  (If you're considering buying a 9x12 you probably have a few of these lying around)\n\nTABLET & SCREEN AREA\n\nif you don't like the overabundance of space, you can always limit the tablet area in the Wacom control panel to ANY dimensions up to 9x12, mapped to any area of the pad.  I feel sometimes that I am moving my arm way too far all over this space for most of my work, so it's good to know I can reduce the physical tablet area controlling the entire screen to a 3x5 box in the corner.  This particular feature is very good for \"tracing\" a photo or small object placed on the tablet and still drawing to the entire screen.\n\nLikewise you can limit the amount of screen area the whole tablet can control.  For VERY VERY precise control over a small screen area this is the best option.  An alternative to zooming the image to work details.  Also useful for avoiding accidental menu-clicks, and prevents the pointer from migrating into toolboxes or clicking scrollbars and other windows.\n\nAll this space does provide a fantastic level of control.  It's just different.  You realize how little you move the mouse most of the time to work on a computer when you start using your entire arm to work.  Usually it's all about the flick of the wrist.\n\nQUICKPOINT \"VIRTUAL-TABLETS\"\n\nAn added bonus I discovered (not on the smaller tablets to my knowledge) is the \"Quickpoint\" dual tablet feature. Two \"virtual\" tablets control the same screen.  The lower left or right corner becomes a tiny 2x3 tablet, and the upper left/right opposite corner becomes a 7x9 tablet (approximately).  The 2x3 gives you fast access to the whole screen with very little pointer movement, and the 7x9 gives you precision control.  Two tablets in one!\n\nWIDESCREEN / DUAL MONITOR SUPPORT\n\nHappy to say it works very well with dual screens.  You can span both screens using the full tablet, choose which screen to control exclusively, or reduce the functional tablet area to match the aspect ratio of spanned/dual monitors.  \n\nAs far as widescreen monitor support, this tablet can automatically adjust the active area to match the aspect ratio of any screen.  So if you are considering the 6x11 widescreen Wacom, remember this tablet can double as a 7x12 widescreen.  I used a grey Sharpie to draw faint lines on the tablet surface to map out different screen ratios.\n\nBASICS\n\nUSB of course.. Nice 8 foot cord so you can move around a bit, excellent for putting the tablet in your lap.  Has a pretty blue light.\n\nThankfully the 1/2 \"tracing overlay\" is gone. Sorry to whoever was saying that was the primary feature for them.. In my experience it just gets dirt and coffee and whatever else you carelessly do to your tablet all stuck up in it. And if you accidentally crease it.. oh the pain... \n\nSTYLUS & NIBS\n\nThe grip pen is nice, bigger than the Intuos 2 pen and has a good weight, otherwise the same. The \"6D\" art pen actually has two tips inside the felt nib, but sometimes the tablet doesn't register both tips (critical to rotation data) unless you plunk the nib down FLAT on the tablet before you start your stroke.  Without both tips active it just works like the grip pen.\n\nThe nibs are interesting, I haven't discovered how the springloaded \"Stroke Nib\" is so much different from the standard white plastic nib.  Says it's \"amazing\" on the website but really.. ehh.  But the \"Felt Nib\" is definitely different.  Kind of makes me think of a Flair Pen.  It has considerable friction against the surface and squeaks on the tablet like a marker. This is good if your hand isn't surgeon-steady or if you want slower more precise strokes, but it is a bit grabby if you press too hard. Draw lines with a Sharpie marker on copier paper with a little extra pressure and it feels about the same.  My previous trick with the Intuos 2 was to tape paper on top of the tablet to add friction. \n\nMOUSE \n\nAs for the 5D mouse, I think it's easier to use a regular mouse on the side.  Although the extra surface area makes a mouse much more practical on this pad than it is on a 4x5.  \n\nThe mouse will jitter and is act strange IF you don't put the tablet in \"mouse mode.\"  The software *should* just do that automatically, but sometimes it doesn't catch on.  Once the mouse is specifically set to mouse mode in the driver settings it should stay in mouse mode any time it's on the pad, and can be moved relative to wherever screen pointer is just like a regular mouse. Otherwise in pen mode the mouse directly tracks the tablet precisely where you place it, and the screen pointer jumps to that spot--just like the pens.  If you WANT you can put the pens in mouse mode, but again, weird.\n\nMACROS\n\nI use the Wacom mice mostly to run unrestricted macros that Microsoft and Logitech don't seem to want to let you run with their \"programmable\" mice these days.  Think \"QuicKeys\" on a mouse. You can program an unlimited string of keystrokes and menu commands, and link the macros globally or restrict them to specific applications.\n\nTHE \"EXPRESS KEYS\"\n(THOSE RECTANGLE THINGS ON THE SIDES)\n\nYou can program the left and right sets independently.  Again, you have complete control of any method of macro you'd like to assign to any of the buttons.  There is a whole list of options for each button and both scroll bars.  So you have eight buttons and two scrolls to program to your heart's desire on the pad.  IN ADDITION to simple button macros there is a \"pop up menu\" you can assign to any of the buttons.  Just like a Windows Right-Click menu, it appears wherever the pointer is--only you have complete control of the menu content.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMy only gripe goes to Adobe for disabling most of the stylus/pen features in Photoshop by default. It gets a little tiresome enabling size, opacity, tilt, and rotation for almost every brush.. \n\nAs for everything else the tablet was meant to do different from a mouse, pressure sensitivity, tilt, rotation, high resolution tracking, lack of jitter.. it works fantastically. I'm just going to have to adjust to the huge 9x12 stroke. So give your Aiptek to someone you hate this Christmas, and hook yourself up with a Wacom! \n\nNext up, Cintiq!  Paycheck.. well, better job, paycheck, THEN Cintiq!\n\n---------------------------\n\nWISH LIST\n\nWhy do we have only one pointer (focus point) on the screen?  Why not a dedicated pointer per-device now that USB makes the mouse addressable?\n\nA \"Wacom Glove\" would be great.  If I could put on a special glove or just little thimble-nibs and have fingertip control on this tablet they'd have one helluva product.  Kids could fingerpaint!\n\nIn addition to that, is there any technical reason why given the right input device this thing couldn't function like one giant \"touchpad\" with surface area detection and everything?  If the 6D can recognize two points simultaneously, what's the technical limit?\n\nbye", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I have to say that after years and years of greedily drooling at the thought of getting a 9x12 Intuos tablet , I have finally purchased the 9x12 Intuos 3 .

The product deserves the excellent iLounge review it received.  The sound is great.  It has an audio in port and an S-Video out port on the back.  I cannot for the life of me understand why there are $300 units made by Apple and Bose that are nothing more than some speakers.  Additionally, the AM/FM tuner works well.  I really only use the FM tuner but have found it to be good - better than I expected but not perfect.  However, once again, most units at this price point do not have any sort of AM/FM tuner and that was a sacrifice I was not willing to make.  For all of these reasons I really do like the Audio Station.\n\nHowever, if there was even another product on the market with these characteristics (AM/FM, S-Video out, audio in) I would have taken my business elsewhere in a second.  My experience with Logitech was TERRIBLE.  First, I brought home a unit from Best Buy in early February and found that it was one of a bad batch that went out to Best Buy stores (see other reviews on this page for more details on which units have the problem with buttons not responding).  After the buttons on the front of the unit didn't respond I got online and read the reviews posted here on Amazon as well as on Logitech's own website where they finally admitted that this was a flawed product.  I then contacted Logitech to see about having a product sent to me as part of the warranty.\n\nThe representative at Logitech told me I would be better off taking my unit back to Best Buy.  I realized that I knew more about the problem with the Audio Station than the customer service rep did after only about 20 minutes of poking around online.  I told him that apparantly a bad batch went out to Best Buy stores and the last thing I was going to do was to waste my time returning a product to Best Buy only to bring another faulty unit back home.  I also told him that I'd read that Audio Stations coming directly from the factory were reportedly working fine and I wanted one of those.  After some time on the phone we arranged for my unit to be picked up and then I would receive a new unit in 10 days.\n\n10 days later I called.  This was the first time I found out that the unit was out of stock and my order was on backorder.  I was furious that I had to call to find out the item was on backorder.  Not only was this the first I heard of the problem but there was nothing they could do for me.  I was told the first week of March they would recieve some in the warehouse.  I waited.  About 8 days into March I called again.  The order hadn't made it to the warehouse.  A small order was due to arrive but it was not guaranteed that I would get one of them.  Again, I was very displeased but there was nothing I could do.  \n\nThis was the first time that a customer representative seemed to know what he was talking about and actually served as an advocate for me.  To their credit, I did recieve a unit out of that first batch.  It arrived relatively quickly and works fine.  However, it was a terrible, terrible experience along the way.\n\nIf you buy one of these, I guarantee buying directly from the factory.  Logitech does not seem inclined to recall their bad units and appears to be content with letting customers deal with their problem.  If you do buy from Best Buy or from Amazon, be careful - you may receive one of the flawed units and who knows how long it will take a replacement to get to you.

Since there were none in my area to look at (and compare screen sharpness, contrast, etc. to others), I was taking a blind shot in the dark to buy it over the internet.  But, from what others were praising about on the features of the 537H on the internet....I took a leap of faith.\n\nI'll do my review from a 'newbie' standpoint on review.  The more experienced can sift through it for what they want.\n\nThe 537H comes in a cardboard box that's found wanting of more sturdiness.  I mean, we're talking about many hundreds of dollars sitting inside of the box.  One wrong hard turn from the UPS/Fedex/whoever delivery guy can send the TV falling into a more stout package on the truck.  Just remember that with newegg's \"bulk shipment\" policy (if you're buying from them).  Mine, thankfully, came undamaged, box and all.  \n\nEverything was with the TV (remote/remote instructions/quick setup of wires/CD...CD?  What?).  The only problem with the accesories is the fact that the CD contains the ENTIRE instruction manual....and it's only used by a computer.  This is not a playable DVD by a DVD player.  So, remember to have a computer to use so you can get to those valuable instructions in your first days of uncertainty with the TV.  If you don't own a computer, that's a big negative against Olevia.\n\nI get my TV all squared away with the wiring hookup and turn it on, hoping that setting up over-the-air digital channels wouldn't be a hard thing to do.  Wrong.  First off, the TV has a great picture.  No doubt.  It certainly competes with the higher-priced/similarly-sized products in picture quality.  My DVD movies haven't looked cleaner/sharper/brighter ever on a component wire hookup.  But......back to the tuner features.  The set automatically started giving me fits with the Closed Captioning.  Why was it turned on?  Who knows?  The big question was \"why won't it turn off?\".  The OSD is about as 'friendly' (Olevia's opinion, not mine) as a rabid dog frothing at the mouth.  First, it is not a list menu, but a 'rolling' menu which can be confusing to some people.  Secondly, the menu has too many choices that could be put under more generalized sections.  And last, you can never be sure that the TV has taken your 'selection' of something on the menu.  No blinking, no beeping, no confirmation at all.  Another negative to add.\n\nThe remote, however, was refreshingly nice.  Many people in reviews complain that the TV isn't on their universal remote's code list, and therefore can't be used by it.  Soooooo, why not try to use Olevia's?  Olevia's universal remote has an extensive list of components it can control, along with SEVEN (that's right, SEVEN) separate component control...not counting the TV controlling ability.  The remote even had the code to my Yamaha home theater amplifier, which was quite suprising and pleasing to me.  The backlight control is strong and controls can be easily seen in dark rooms.  Sadly, the remote also could use some extra thought.  It does have 'hotkeys' to help you take care of some TV controls, but only a 'Funtion' key to move the control ability down the list of components it can control.  No direct jump to, say, DVD to TV or AUDIO to TV.  The same goes for the source.  If you want to go from TUNER to COMPONENT 1, you have to key your way through the list on the TV until you get to the source signal you want.  A good leap forward would be hotkeys for both of these problems, but they're not on this remote.\n\nAll in all, you just can't beat the price for the quality picture the Olevia 537H exudes.  However, for many novice buyers of TVs, this LCD will be a challenge to master.\n\nI give this set four stars, mainly for picture quality....but it almost fell to three because of the inconvienent features and unfriendly OSD.
