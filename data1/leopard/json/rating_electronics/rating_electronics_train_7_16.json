However, words like crisp and detailed are very meager adjectives to describe the musical sonic characteristics of this cartridge (true, the rest of your component system's own sound characteristics come into play, i.e; receiver,amp,pre-amp,turntable,speakers).If any part of your audio system does not have that \"synergy\", then you may notice either slight, miniscule shortcomings from the cartridge or system or both.For those with already a warm or neutral sounding system will be dramatically surprised and awestruck. For those who have just the opposite type of system and also may have an eq inline, you may want to adjust your treble settings. The AT 440ML is NOT a neutral or \"warm\" sounding cartridge---far from it. The upper mids and highs will possibly have your dog running out of the room. It's not bass shy either. Bass is firm  but never muddy or boomy. It reproduces the lows and highs very well.There are no punchy mids (though the mids are reproduced admirably but not accurately). Some critics have said this cartridge out of the box and installed properly is reminiscent of having an inline equalizer and it's frequency knob controls in the \"v\" formation. Stereo channel separation is probably the best these ears have heard over any other stereo cartridge I have had in the past (from the Grado Prestige Series to a couple of high-end Shure cartridges).There is definitely a 3-dimensional sonic imaging characteristic in the AT 440ML (especially noted with acoustic and jazz music). The Audio Technica beats most other hi end named brands to the punch with such wide stereo stage channel separation. I have closed my eyes with headphones on or with speakers and I always hear and experience the \"you are there\" feeling that makes me appreciate records much more than the cold 2-dimensional flat sound of audio cd's. Female vocals have a soft but clear presence.Male vocals are well reproduced. The micro-linear stylus reaches deep into the grooves without carving the vinyl (YES ! a wonderful light tracker that requires anywhere from .8 to 1.6 g of tracking force).This will cut down on the wear and tear of your vinyl collection as well as your cartridge/stylus...\n\nDoes this mean that the AT 440ML is PERFECT and that you have finally reached analog playback nirvana??? Well, that depends on different viewpoints. If you have bought cheap cartridges all your life in the $20 to $40 range, then this AT 440ML will be an audio revelation that will have you realize what you have been missing all this time. BUT, it's only a taste of the high end, audiophile analog world. If you have had other hi-end name brand cartridges (an experienced audiophile) and have paid more than what this cartridge is going for, then from a monetary stance you may have paid too much---that is IF the AT's sound rivals or is reminiscent of those pricier carts. On the other hand, if you prefer the warm, neutral sound to your liking, and possibly don't want to experience ear and mind fatigue from a bright cartridge then do not buy this cartridge.The AT 440 ML is a colored (soundwise) cartridge.You will only become ear fatigued if you are used to more neutral or warm cartridges (this is where you will need to adjust your treble settings). As with most cartridges, the AT 440 ML does require a little bit of \"breaking-in\" period (some say 30 hours to maybe 50---depending on your playback time habits). I have owned the AT 440ML for over a year now and it does get more looser or liquid-like, smooth and sweeter in sound(but not warm or dull) with no harsh or grainy sonic characteristics (sounds like I'm describing a fine liquor or malt shake). \n\nThe last glaring question (probably one of the most important) is whether or not this is an excellent tracker (and this is a two-fold question or concern). Are words beginning with s, t, p, and f accurately reproduced (sibilance)? Yes and no.That honorary distinction would be for the Shure V15VxMR cartridge (which is now out of production and was the last of a dying audiophile cartridge breed to be had for a reasonable price range). With the AT 440ML it's more hit than miss with sibilants. About 85% to 90% of the time \"spitty\" consonants are pronounced accurately with a slight edge or exaggeration. However, there have been a few of my clean records where the letter \"s\" cuts through with that static-like harshness more than once on any given side.One such record I have that proves this theory and shortcoming of this cartridge is  Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive swing jazz album (the letter s is tracked harshly with that annoying edgy sound). As for overall tracking quality of the music signal in general from beginning of groove to end, it has that inner groove distortion problem licked (this is where the AT 440ML shows off it's greatest audiophile strength). This is due to the linear contact stylus. Nothing MORE aggravating to a record listener than when a low budget or poorly produced cartridge, while it may sound clear and great in the first few tracks on a record side, but then as the needle goes towards the center, the last tracks suffer horribly (no matter how much anti-skate force you apply)! You will no longer have this problem with the AT 440ML; you will finally find out what you have been missing. \n\nKeep in mind that this deep-groove tracing microlinear stylus by design,in picking up such fine musical detail, will also pick up record surface noise and dirt;That's right, that snap,crackle, and pop from static,dirt, or lint.Majority of micro-linear cartridges will do that as opposed to conical or elliptical styli that sort of tend to almost try to soften,mask or even blend out surface record noise.  Conical or elliptical styli,with their larger \"footprint\" tip, will push dirt and other debris out of the way on the record's surface. They also do not reach deep into the groove and make that much of an accurate contact with the groove's wall as a microlinear stylus does. The microlinear stylus will reach deeper into the groove where there is more accumulated dirt or debris;it's a fact(being a light tracker however, this will not wear out your records as fast as a regular stylus cartrdige would). So, I also recommend using an anti-static brush on those not so pristine records.This is the only other area where maybe it's competitor ,the Shure M97xE cartridge, might come out a little ahead; Shures are well known and admired for their almost quiet record surface noise playback and background !\n\nThe bottom line, with both thumbs highly up, I absolutely recommend this fine cartridge. Period. Especially for a novice to the vinyl world or someone on a budget.I have found it difficult to listen to cd's or any digital musical format since owning this cartridge. In fact, I get bored with cd playback nowadays. There's just no musical \"involvement\".Don't be fooled by the simple black and lavender/purple? colored simple looking cartridge. It's what's on the inside of the body that really counts ! The AT 440ML possesses that bang for the buck quality that is hard to beat and will revitalize your long yearning for super (not perfect) audiophile listening and extract nuances and other fine qualities from your record collection !", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Who says you have to spend an x amount of hundreds even thousands of dollars on a phono cartridge to listen to crisp and detailed vinyl / analog playback ?

I've had a tendency in the past to neglect photo printing because once I get our pictures onto my computer, I want to fiddle with them endlessly to \"improve\" them before I print them out.  In the end I never do get around to it.  Now we'll come home from a day of photo shooting, look at our pics on the TV and print out the good ones - then I can touch up the photos that need it at my leisure.  And if I am too lazy to even do that, it's simple enough for someone else to take over, meaning it's much more likely to get done. It was great coming back from a Hawaiian vacation with my family and printing out pictures that day for them to take home!\n\nThis printer doesn't get 5 stars because of photo quality vs. cost of goods.  You can get the printing packs for half a buck per photo, but professional printing will cost less.  The photos from pros will usually look better too.  While this is a dye sublimation printer, it only uses three colors of ink, so better inkjets, dye-subs and professional prints will have better colors than this machine.  Based purely on tech specs this one should beat out most of the cheaper inkjets (including other stand alone photo printers in the same price range) but I haven't seen any side-by-side comparisons.  On the plus side, the Sony does \"print\" a transparent layer over the picture that'll keep it from fading for quite a while.  As for my personal opinion of the printouts (as a casual pic taker with a Canon SD500), I would give them an A-/B+.  The colors could be a bit more vibrant, but I have also been surprised by just how much they will pop in a good pic.  Ultimately however I feel that the convenience of having everyone sitting on the couch and picking out the photos they want through the television means the minor cost/quality issue becomes inconsequential, because without that convenience those pictures might never see the light of day in any form.\n\nOverall I would recommend this unit to friends who do casual printing and want something that is very simple to use.  I've even considered sending one to my mother for Christmas.  While the interface as a whole is perhaps not quite as intuitive to use as an ipod, anyone who isn't scared by a cellphone or basic computer use should be able to handle it easily.  It's also flexible, taking a variety of card formats and providing different options for choosing the pictures you want to print - though I would be surprised if you ever used anything but the TV out.  And ultimately I think that anyone who gets it will be printing more photos than before. \n\nFinally, a couple of notes for those who decide to take the plunge.  Don't count on finding the 3.5x5 paper easily, I haven't seen it anywhere.  ALL of the 4x6 paper is \"postcard paper\" - I was a bit confused at first looking for \"normal\" 4x6 packs.  The paper has tear-off edges on the left and right - it's micro-perforated so you wont get any rough edges, but it's a bit of a pain to tear off without \"fingerprinting\" or creasing the photo.

However, my Pre-N router died and true to their word Belkin promptly replaced it. At this point I was willing to invest in a Belkin's N-1 laptop card just to see how it performed. In fact I bought 2. I installed one card in a couple of year old Dell which is in an upstairs location while the router is downstairs. The laptop reports a very good to excellent signal amd \"300 mbps\" - it is noticable faster in pulling files from other network devices. The other laptop is a bit older Gateway. It too is upstairs, directly overhead from the router. It does not report as strong of a signal but seems to get the job done and reports faster than \"108 mbps\" and sometimes \"300 mbps\". While I have not experimented with placing the stronger signaled Dell in the location of the Gateway to see how it performs, I suspect that the difference is attributable to the Gateway being older technology.\n\nThe greatest challenge I had with setting up the network was with security. I succeeded with the security mode of WPA/WPA-2 Personal (PSK); Authentication of WPA/PSK; Encryption Technique of AES (I could not establish connection between my computers using TKP Encryption Technique). \n\nIn summary, setting up the network took some effort and familiarity with networks - how to set and change properties in the network connection both on the laptops and the browser interface with the router. Once the network was established its performance has been reliable and faster.

The manual references a few features that I cannot seem to locate on the player and is also not very helpful in walking you through how to convert files to a compatible format that the player will play. New users could give the PMC a bad review due to the lack of the user friendliness manual. The USB plug cover is annoying as hell when trying to plug in the USB cable. You want to rip it off the player but then you risk getting dirt in the USB port. The power cord should have either had a 90* connector or the recepticle should have been located towards the bottom of the player. The player easily tips over because of this. Lastly, why is there no STOP button? iPods don't have this either but when I'm finished listening or watching I want to return to the main menu without what I was doing being paused in the background (you can actually see it). All of these grips are easily outweighed by the players other features though.\nOn to the good parts... The video quality appears really good. The hard part is finding consistant information and software that will convert your DVD videos to WMV format. Video conversion all depends on the speed of your PC. My PC took about 1 hour to convert a 30 min episode of South Park to a WMV file and a few minutes to transfer the 177mb file to the PMC.\nJPEG picture quality is excellent. I resized all of my pics to the 320x240 screen size (keeping the aspect ratio). You can play any song(s) while the slideshow is playing too. The lack of slideshow control is a slight downside.\nOne other feature I would have expected from a slightly bulky PMC is a FM tuner. Sometimes there are live events that you'd like to listen to without having to carry another device with you.\nHopefully a future BIOS update will allow more options/flexability for the playlist, slideshow, etc...\nPrice, definitely worth %50+/- of the MSRP of $499.99 ($250).\nI would have easily given 5 stars had the manual been a little more helpful and accurate and had the MSRP been in a more affordable/reasonable range.\nOct 6, 2006 - After playing around with the device for several hours I have found some of the features listed in the manual. This doesn't mean that the manual is correct in the way it informs you how to access these features though. You can actually override the players conversion settings and transfer other file formats to the player to see if they will play. You still must use the Media Players sync feature to get an understandable meta tag for the files, or you just get an \"unknown\". You must use MP10 to access the players sync options.\nI'm not quite sure how the FM tuner add-on works since all ports (except USB) are output.\nAfter spending countless hours trying to find freeware that converts DVD files to WMV I find that I already had a program that would partially do this for me.

First off , I initially decided to write my review because the only - other - review ( at the time I ' m writing this ) is for 1 - star ? ! ? I ' m hoping the law of averages washes - out the 1 - star review simply because this is NOT a 1 - star product . . . The only way to beef - up the number of stars this product deserves is to speak up , so I am ! : - ) That said , [SEP]"}, {"sentence1": "Just got my Super Fi 5 Pro's and I like them.  I have owned Shure's E3C and Etymotic Er4-P.  My girlfriend needed new phones, so I gave my Shure E3Cs and bought the Etymotic.  I recently left them inside a rental car (big bummer) so I needed a new pair and decided to see what else was out there.  The Etys had amzing clairty in the high end and nice mids.  They fit beautifully and were very easy to put in with the triple flanged sleeves.  The only complaint I had was that the bass, while you could \"experience\" it aurally, you never really \"felt\" it.  I like my bass.  So from what I read online, the Super Fi's would be a good alternative and a bit cheaper than replacing the Etys.  After listening to jazz, classical, some Snoop, and Stone Temple Pilots, the bass is indeed impressive.  The mids are nice and, using an iPOd, you can customize the sound using the iPod EQ.  I am not as impressed with the highs (not nearly as defined and crisp as the Etys) but the highs ARE still there.  I am willing to compromise a bit of the high end to get more bass.  The fit is relatively straightforward and the stock medium rubber sleeves work fine, though the double flange sleeves work, too.  I did like how easy the Etys were to put in (the UEs require that you do a bit more adjusting as you put them in and wrap the wire around the top of your ear like most musicians) but I'm sure it will become second nature.  Overall, from someone who has owned high end earphones and got a degree in Music, I think the Super Fi's are a good value.  To get the same bass and even better treble, I think you'd need to spend about twice as much and for playing compressed music on an iPod, I just don't think it's worth it.  These phones are a nice compromise", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Just got my Super Fi 5 Pro ' s and I like them . I have owned Shure ' s E3C and Etymotic Er4 - P .
