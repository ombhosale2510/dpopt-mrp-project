The Dioshield performs fantastically on all three counts. \n\nNonetheless, the case only rates 2 stars, as there are some significant design flaws. Before I discuss these flaws, however, I should mention that the hold button problem that others have mentioned in their reviews appears to have been resolved. My case arrived a few days ago, and the cut out for the hold button was more than large enough to allow free and easy access. If I want to, I can use my thumb to engage or disengage the hold switch while the iPod is in the case. However, this does bring us to the first of the aforementioned design flaws: the cut-out hole for the headphones. It is, admittedly, the perfect size for the jack on the Apple ear-bud headphones. However, I have Shure E2C's, which have a slightly wider jack, and they were not able to fit through the Dioshield's headphone cut-out. So if you have after-market headphones, especially ones with a 90 degree angled jack, or one that is particularly thick, you may run into compatibility issues. More alarming, the jack on my AV cord wouldn't fit into the headphone cut-out on the Dioshield, either, meaning that I'd need to take the iPod out of it's case if I wanted to watch a show on my television. I managed to work-around this problem by enlarging the hole with a Dremel, but still... it is annoying, and if you don't have a Dremel, or are reluctant to take it to your new case, then you might be s.o.l. when it comes to AV cables or better quality headphones.\n\nOkay, onto the second design flaw. I'm just going to quote a fellow reviewer, H. Park, who articulated this problem most succinctly and clearly: \"The bottom of the case leaves a hole for the sync/charge cable. However, because of the proximity of the hinges, it's almost impossible to use the Apple-provided USB sync cable, since this cable is the locking variety with the unlock buttons on the sides of the cable plug. Once the sync cable is inserted and the lock engaged, a narrow object like a knife blade or ruler is required to disengage the cable.\"  This is super-annoying and a puzzling oversight. Why even have the hole there? It's like some kind of cruel joke, reminding us of what we could almost have if only we had bought a different case.\n\nFinally, and this is just a matter of personal taste, and not design, that whole lanyard thing just seems stupid. The iPod with Video is simply not comfortable to wear around your neck for any period of time, plus it bounces around everytime you walk. It is really annoying. I ended up cutting mine off and throwing it away. No one is going to use it that way, and I'm betting that even a modicum of market research would have revealed that. But that's just me. However, I stand by the first two criticisms I made - those are substantial design flaws that make an otherwise excellent product into a merely mediocre one. Yes, you can use better headphones if you take a Dremel to the case, and yes, you can charge the iPod if you take it out of the case, but the whole point is, you shouldn't have to do either of those things, and a case that requires you to do so is substandard.\n\nI doubt I'm going to replace this case with anything else. I have it now, and while I'm not overwhelmed by it, I can go so far as to say that I am whelmed by it. It does what it's supposed to, and I can cope with it's deficits, but I would not buy it again nor can I recommend it all that strongly.
