It was stereo and in the store it sounded AMAZING - I bought one and took it home and it sounded tinny, flat and cheap. I found out that Bose charges a ton to pay for their marketing. They still use PAPER speaker drivers! I returned that acoustimass system and years later tried the 1-2-3 system (2 years ago) I hooked up the new system and was underwhelmed. My Sony 60\" XBR TV speakers sounded just as good. I returned it to the Bose store, sweraing to never buy another Bose product. (I did buy some Tri-Port headphones which were VERY muddy and bloated sounding)\n\nWell, 2 weeks ago I was in a bose store and I saw the Wave Music System and the new Acoustic Wave System. The guy in the store told me the new (larger) acoustic wave system was their best stereo system. I bought one for $1079 and took it home. It sounded HORRIBLE. Harsh, flat and NOT spacious (this is the larger acoustic wave) at all! I felt ripped off. It was ugly, cheap looking and sounded horrible. My Tivoli Model 1 sounded better. Not as loud but better. Off to the Bose store I go to return it.\n\n(Let me also say that 3 years ago I owned a $25,000 STEREO only system with super high end tube amps, pre amps, a $5k CD player, etc. It was my dream system that I had to sell last year as I was having some money issues. I REALLY missed my system.)\n\nSo I return to Bose and look at the little, smaller Wave Music System. It sounded spacious, big and had a depth to it that was very pleasing. It sounded MUCH better than their so called \"BEST\" system. I was shocked that Bose would make a $1079 product that sounded BAD and much worse than their $500 system. I decided to take on home in Graphite to give themn one last chance. Took it home, set it up and WOW! It looked great on my table. Very nice look and I LOVE that it has no buttons on it. PLugged it in....\n\nThis is what I have been looking for! Deep, BIG, spacious, room filling sound with just enough Bass. It sounded AMAZING on piano music, jazz, classical, vocals, big band...I then threw in some rock consisting of AC/DC, KISS and even metallica. It sounded VERY good. Not as good as with the other music but still had bass, and sounded very very good. I WAS FINALLY HAPPY WITH A BOSE PRODUCT!\n\nAdd to this the alarm function, the auto dimming display and small size and you will think that $500 is a deal. I bought the large backlit remote for $39 to go with it the next day. The Bose Wave Music System IS a GREAt sounding system. Those who bash this new version never heard it, period. Remember, I came from a $25,000 system and nothing made me happy until this system. NOT that this is in any way better or even comparable to my $25k system, but it kills the larger Acoustic Wave, the Tivoli model 1, the Boston Acoustics $500 set and the Cambride set. (yes, I tried them all)\n\nIf you wanted a Wave system but are afraid of the bad reviews, don't be. This new version is WONDERFUL and fills my house with rich, clear, deep sound.
