After looking at reviews of all of the different options, the Sony DAV-FX100W appeared like the best choice. I'm very happy with that decision. DVDs look great on my HDTV with the 1080i upscaling feature. Be forewarned, if you wish to use this feature you will need to purchase a very expensive HDMI cable and your TV will need to be support it. I bought a 3ft Belkin cable (instead of Monster) and it was still over $100. DVDs also sound terrific; the surround is impressive for a wireless solution. Like any stereo, it is important to adjust to levels for each speaker, and I pumped up the surround speakers a little as well as the center channel. The subwoofer, as others have stated, is pretty powerful for a passive speaker. There could be more depth to the sound, however, it is an out of the box solution and I think it sounds good enough as long as the standard output is kept at it's default sound level. Others have complained that CDs don't sound good; I disagree. I've played several CDs and I think they sound great. I also input my iPod through the Video1 audio inputs, and that sounds pretty great too. Again, like any receive, you'll need to play with the settings and audio fields to enhance the sound to your liking.

You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle.

When I decided to get this router to replace my AWFUL D-Link WBR-2310, I thought I would be taking a risk since I'd never heard much about Buffalo.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with this router, right from the moment I opened the box.  The unit is sleek-looking, well-built, and has a well-engineered antenna... not one of the flimsy cheap 3 inch tall antennas most routers ship with... this one is about 8 inches tall and made of a solid material.  The router has all of its basic setup information printed on a label on the bottom of the unit - the default IP address, MAC address, user name, default password, etc.  Most other companies just include the router MAC address and nothing else.  The attention to detail with things like the antenna type and the setup label demonstrate, in my opinion, that Buffalo is committed to making products that last and have the features people really want.  Heck - because of that label, I didn't even have to use the manual to hook the unit up and get it working.  Everything needed for setup is right there on the unit so you don't have to deal with finding the manual in a year or two if you need to clear the router's settings and set it up again from the default \"factory-programmed\" state.\n\nSetup was a snap and took me about five minutes.  I also set the router up to use the new WPA-PSK encryption technology for wireless security - WPA-PSK is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more secure than even 128-bit WEP encryption, so this is a wonderful feature for such an inexpensive router.  Two other routers that I've owned have claimed that they supported WPA-PSK, but neither worked properly with it - the wireless would drop frequently with them, etc.  This Buffalo router doesn't have any problems doing WPA-PSK and maintaining a stable wireless signal.  \n\nSetting up port-forwarding so that I can host multiplayer games online (Warcraft 3 in particular) and so I could connect to my home computers while I'm at work was also simple.\n\nMy suggestion - don't take a gamble buying another router.

Since there were none in my area to look at (and compare screen sharpness, contrast, etc. to others), I was taking a blind shot in the dark to buy it over the internet.  But, from what others were praising about on the features of the 537H on the internet....I took a leap of faith.\n\nI'll do my review from a 'newbie' standpoint on review.  The more experienced can sift through it for what they want.\n\nThe 537H comes in a cardboard box that's found wanting of more sturdiness.  I mean, we're talking about many hundreds of dollars sitting inside of the box.  One wrong hard turn from the UPS/Fedex/whoever delivery guy can send the TV falling into a more stout package on the truck.  Just remember that with newegg's \"bulk shipment\" policy (if you're buying from them).  Mine, thankfully, came undamaged, box and all.  \n\nEverything was with the TV (remote/remote instructions/quick setup of wires/CD...CD?  What?).  The only problem with the accesories is the fact that the CD contains the ENTIRE instruction manual....and it's only used by a computer.  This is not a playable DVD by a DVD player.  So, remember to have a computer to use so you can get to those valuable instructions in your first days of uncertainty with the TV.  If you don't own a computer, that's a big negative against Olevia.\n\nI get my TV all squared away with the wiring hookup and turn it on, hoping that setting up over-the-air digital channels wouldn't be a hard thing to do.  Wrong.  First off, the TV has a great picture.  No doubt.  It certainly competes with the higher-priced/similarly-sized products in picture quality.  My DVD movies haven't looked cleaner/sharper/brighter ever on a component wire hookup.  But......back to the tuner features.  The set automatically started giving me fits with the Closed Captioning.  Why was it turned on?  Who knows?  The big question was \"why won't it turn off?\".  The OSD is about as 'friendly' (Olevia's opinion, not mine) as a rabid dog frothing at the mouth.  First, it is not a list menu, but a 'rolling' menu which can be confusing to some people.  Secondly, the menu has too many choices that could be put under more generalized sections.  And last, you can never be sure that the TV has taken your 'selection' of something on the menu.  No blinking, no beeping, no confirmation at all.  Another negative to add.\n\nThe remote, however, was refreshingly nice.  Many people in reviews complain that the TV isn't on their universal remote's code list, and therefore can't be used by it.  Soooooo, why not try to use Olevia's?  Olevia's universal remote has an extensive list of components it can control, along with SEVEN (that's right, SEVEN) separate component control...not counting the TV controlling ability.  The remote even had the code to my Yamaha home theater amplifier, which was quite suprising and pleasing to me.  The backlight control is strong and controls can be easily seen in dark rooms.  Sadly, the remote also could use some extra thought.  It does have 'hotkeys' to help you take care of some TV controls, but only a 'Funtion' key to move the control ability down the list of components it can control.  No direct jump to, say, DVD to TV or AUDIO to TV.  The same goes for the source.  If you want to go from TUNER to COMPONENT 1, you have to key your way through the list on the TV until you get to the source signal you want.  A good leap forward would be hotkeys for both of these problems, but they're not on this remote.\n\nAll in all, you just can't beat the price for the quality picture the Olevia 537H exudes.  However, for many novice buyers of TVs, this LCD will be a challenge to master.\n\nI give this set four stars, mainly for picture quality....but it almost fell to three because of the inconvienent features and unfriendly OSD.  As for me, it will be quite some time (and never for any of my relations trying to use it during get-togethers) before I'm comfortable in using the TV and remote", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I went through many LCDs , looking and comparing , and stopped on the 537H from Olevia .
