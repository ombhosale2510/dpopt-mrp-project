Since there were none in my area to look at (and compare screen sharpness, contrast, etc. to others), I was taking a blind shot in the dark to buy it over the internet.  But, from what others were praising about on the features of the 537H on the internet....I took a leap of faith.\n\nI'll do my review from a 'newbie' standpoint on review.  The more experienced can sift through it for what they want.\n\nThe 537H comes in a cardboard box that's found wanting of more sturdiness.  I mean, we're talking about many hundreds of dollars sitting inside of the box.  One wrong hard turn from the UPS/Fedex/whoever delivery guy can send the TV falling into a more stout package on the truck.  Just remember that with newegg's \"bulk shipment\" policy (if you're buying from them).  Mine, thankfully, came undamaged, box and all.  \n\nEverything was with the TV (remote/remote instructions/quick setup of wires/CD...CD?  What?).  The only problem with the accesories is the fact that the CD contains the ENTIRE instruction manual....and it's only used by a computer.  This is not a playable DVD by a DVD player.  So, remember to have a computer to use so you can get to those valuable instructions in your first days of uncertainty with the TV.  If you don't own a computer, that's a big negative against Olevia.\n\nI get my TV all squared away with the wiring hookup and turn it on, hoping that setting up over-the-air digital channels wouldn't be a hard thing to do.  Wrong.  First off, the TV has a great picture.  No doubt.  It certainly competes with the higher-priced/similarly-sized products in picture quality.  My DVD movies haven't looked cleaner/sharper/brighter ever on a component wire hookup.  But......back to the tuner features.  The set automatically started giving me fits with the Closed Captioning.  Why was it turned on?  Who knows?  The big question was \"why won't it turn off?\".  The OSD is about as 'friendly' (Olevia's opinion, not mine) as a rabid dog frothing at the mouth.  First, it is not a list menu, but a 'rolling' menu which can be confusing to some people.  Secondly, the menu has too many choices that could be put under more generalized sections.  And last, you can never be sure that the TV has taken your 'selection' of something on the menu.  No blinking, no beeping, no confirmation at all.  Another negative to add.\n\nThe remote, however, was refreshingly nice.  Many people in reviews complain that the TV isn't on their universal remote's code list, and therefore can't be used by it.  Soooooo, why not try to use Olevia's?  Olevia's universal remote has an extensive list of components it can control, along with SEVEN (that's right, SEVEN) separate component control...not counting the TV controlling ability.  The remote even had the code to my Yamaha home theater amplifier, which was quite suprising and pleasing to me.  The backlight control is strong and controls can be easily seen in dark rooms.  Sadly, the remote also could use some extra thought.  It does have 'hotkeys' to help you take care of some TV controls, but only a 'Funtion' key to move the control ability down the list of components it can control.  No direct jump to, say, DVD to TV or AUDIO to TV.  The same goes for the source.  If you want to go from TUNER to COMPONENT 1, you have to key your way through the list on the TV until you get to the source signal you want.  A good leap forward would be hotkeys for both of these problems, but they're not on this remote.\n\nAll in all, you just can't beat the price for the quality picture the Olevia 537H exudes.  However, for many novice buyers of TVs, this LCD will be a challenge to master.\n\nI give this set four stars, mainly for picture quality....but it almost fell to three because of the inconvienent features and unfriendly OSD.  As for me, it will be quite some time (and never for any of my relations trying to use it during get-togethers) before I'm comfortable in using the TV and remote", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] I went through many LCDs , looking and comparing , and stopped on the 537H from Olevia .

My wife's PCI linksys N card went even more smoothly.  My laptop G picked it up easily.  The stability is what has impressed me.  The speed is definitely an improvement but I am not giving numbers because so much relates to what DSL speed or cable speed one is using.  I can tell a significant difference in downloads.
