[{"sentence1": "Before I rate the box set and the four movies I would like to give you a brief history of my life with these films. When I was really young I use to always ask my dad to rent Tremors and we would all set and whatch it. But when I got a bit older and I could understand things better I became afraid and was scared of Grabiods coming up from underneath are house and eating me. Anyways after about two years I got the guts to whatch Tremors 2: After shocks. And Afterwards I was agian afraid of Grabiods and now Shriekers attacking me. Finally after about ten years of not watching them, me and my buddy Travis got to talking about Tremors and he asked me what Grabiods where. So I dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days I ended up creating a Tremors comic. So after becoming so involved with Tremors again I decided to watch the first film again. And after it ended, I bought it off Amazon and a week later I bought the third movie and then another week after that I bought the second. I had literly gone a 180 from fearing Tremors so long ago to become a huge fan. And when the fourth finally came out I had my family, my friend Travis and his brother hooked. Now after being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over I can finally rate them. The original Tremors is by far the best; with it's all star cast and great story line. The second best would have to be Tremors 4: The Legend Begins because it stays more true to the first and it shows how it all began. Tremors 2: After shocks would be third best since it stared Earl and Gummer and Tremors 3: Back to Prefection would have to be the worst since it's story is weak, its short and it takes the evolution thing a bit far. Overall this is a great pack of all four Tremors movies and if I hadn't boughten all of them aready I would buy this Attack Pack. Ps. Tremors 5 script has been finished and if Tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth.

But the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap. I can't believe Robert Towne had a hand in writing this. It's like a rejected plot to a Solid Snake PS1 game. There's seems to be some focus on making it a James Bond/Die Hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces.\n\nAnother major thing that is wrong with this movie however is Zimmer's score.

First, Depp's portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore.\n\nA mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating supernatural abilities.

It's not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood. There are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they're all easy to follow. One follows a stolen ATM machine, one follows the quest for love of an African immigrant, another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend, another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview, and yet another follows a white barber's quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with. In a way, this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like Pulp Fiction that follow many characters and their stories. Each of the stories lead up to the ending where Calvin saves the barbershop.\nDirector Tim Story does a great job of capturing life in Chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop. I felt the spirit of the Windy City and the informal environment of the barbershop.

Ice Cube is great as Calvin. I liked his performance here. Michael Ealy stands out in his role as an ex-con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber. Ealy makes you feel his characters' desperation. Cedric the Entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber. He's funny and poignant. Sean Nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college. Anthony Anderson and Larenz Tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an ATM with no money in it.

How dare you call yourself a horror fan without even seeing it?  You don't have to like it, but damn it, you should at least see it.  You can thank Dracula for all the gothic imagery that's been used time and time again in movies throughout the years, right up to this very day.  You can also thank Dracula for all the goth chicks running around, and that's either a good or bad thing depending on your tastes.  Dracula's not my favorite movie from Universal's golden era, but I've seen it quite a few times in my life and will probably see it many more before I buy the farm.  Lugosi managed to create THE Dracula.  They even discuss this in the documentary on the disc, but even folks who have never seen the film before instantly get the image of Lugosi's Dracula in mind when someone brings the subject of Dracula up.  Even with all the different actors who've played the role over the years(some turning in wonderful performances, some not so wonderful), they all seem to be in Lugosi's shadow somehow coz he just WAS Dracula.  Lugosi gave a voice to Dracula.  Ever do a Dracula impersonation or hear someone else do one?  What voice did you(or they) use? Lugosi's of course.  However, I don't think I'd like this film half as much if it hadn't had been for Dwight Frye as Renfield.  Frye is rather unappreciated and never became well known outside the horror circle.  He is to the character of Renfield what Lugosi is to Dracula.  Sorry, Tom Waits just didn't cut the mustard for me.  This film is many years old and probably wouldn't be considered frightening by a five year old kid.  In fact, it most likely comes across as silly to younger folks with Lugosi's exaggerated stares, hand movements and dialogue.  Not to mention Frye's overacting as well.  But the fact of the matter is, this movie scared the pants off people in it's time.  When was the last time modern audiences saw a film that truely frightened them?  Who knows, and it's not likely to happen again in our rather desensitized society.  In fact, I doubt most modern moviegoers even have the attention span to sit through this 75 minute film.  Anyhow, you owe it to Bela, Dwight and yourself to check it out.  As for the other films in the set, it's kinda hit and miss, but none of them are bad by any means.  Apparently somewhere along the lines, Dracula fathered two kids(!) coz we have Dracula's Daughter and Son Of Dracula.  Neither movie is all that bad.  Dracula's Daughter actually tries to be a direct sequel to the original film with the daughter trying to rid herself of the vampire curse.  Dracula's son on the other hand seems to enjoy the vampire lifestyle.  Chaney makes a decent enough vampire, but this son didn't inherit his father's suaveness and charisma.  The spanish version is a really cool gem that almost seems more atmospheric than the american version.  House Of Dracula's kind of the odd one out as it's really a sequel to House Of Frankenstein, which itself is a sequel to Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man.  House of Dracula is best viewed as a double feature with House Of Frankenstein.  Like the Frankenstein and Wolf Man sets, this one has an interesting documentary tracing Dracula from Bram Stoker's novel right up to the Frank Langella film version.  Also sliming his way into this set is Stephen Sommers flapping his gums again about how Dracula influenced his piece of crap Van Helsing movie.  Don't ask me why I watched this feature, maybe I was looking for a reason to get pissed.  Anyhow, with a price tag like this and five Universal classics, it certainly sold me.", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Dracula .

Just look at \"A Different World\" and how bad the first season was. Debbie Allen (a Howard grad, I believe) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed. So it's no surprise that Spike Lee, the Morehouse man, would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin. I'm not saying that you had to attend an HBCU to UNDERSTAND \"School Daze\", but you had to have attended one to get the real \"flavor\" of what it was like. And you have to have an open mind.\n\nAny HBCU alum saying that this film wasn't realistic is flat-out lying. Yes, it hit on some things that the old folks call \"dirty laundry\" (such as hazing, color issues, those who think that getting an education makes you \"white\", and so on), but those things are real at HBCUs - yes, even today. (Major props to Spike for having that ONE dark-skinned sista in the Gamma Rays. Isn't that ALWAYS the way?) And there are no \"good\" people or bad people; Spike leaves that decision up to you. Julian had his good points (his intelligence, leadership and pride in his town, school, etc) and Dap had his bad points (his blatant bigotry and bullying), and both of them had legitimate points. \n\nOne thing Spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis. No offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a PWC, but in my experience at a predominately white high school, I noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike; they particpated in a more \"destroying from within\" kind of system, and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted, even with solid proof. (\"I would NEVER spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper!\") Black students, on the other hand, will take ANYONE head-on, whether that person is the school president, captain of the football team, the richest kid on campus, crippled...doesn't matter. Your \"status\" doesn't count if you go to an HBCU. I had a friend who saw SD and said \"That is SO unrealistic! Since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time?\" She graduated from the University of Texas. Enough said.\n\nI'm so grateful for this film, and its realistic portrayal of black HBCU students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare, and that people only go to HBCUs because they can't get into a \"real\" college.
