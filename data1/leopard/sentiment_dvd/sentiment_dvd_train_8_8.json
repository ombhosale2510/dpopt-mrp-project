[{"sentence1": "The story of \"Alice in Wonderland\" was controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it.  Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.\n\nAlice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.\nOnce at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled \"drink me\" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.\n\nAlice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing \"Alice in Wonderland\" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.\n\nGiven that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.\n\nI believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.\n\nFor all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches \"Fantasia\" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.\n\nThis movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.

The movie is an eloquent cinematic adaptation of the novel that gives Dostoevsky's central character a new breath of life from the modern day perspective.\n\nThe movie attempts to survey the convoluted mind of a building inspector through a video-taped self confession. The psychological similarities between the character in Dostoevsky's novel and the building supervisor in the movie are uncanny. Both characters share a state of mind that is the epitome of a human condition where miserable anti hero attitude reigns through a heightened level consciousness and the rationality of everyday living through action is put to rest. The character in the movie who identifies himself as a \"sick man, a spiteful man\" lives his life in isolation by the drowning himself into the puddle of his own conflicting thoughts. He despises his friends and at the same time he seems eager to improve his relationship with them.  \n\nThe character in the movie voluntarily creates unpleasant scenarios that trigger his eventual self demise. He often finds himself confined within the conflicting walls of his consciousness. He falls in love with a prostitute but at the same time he is utterly disgusted by her profession and tries to dominate her. By escalating the level of his thought process well above the habitual human awareness, the central character of the movie isolates himself from the crowd that Dostoevsky's narrator identifies as the \"Men of Action\". The building supervisor is paralyzed by the own consciousness just like the narrator in Dostoevsky's novel. \n\nDostoevsky's novel and the movie helps us realize that the collective standard of self-consciousness that the society forces us to adapt through a methodical process of uniformity and conformity, has a negative side effect that is strong enough to paralyze our lives and inflict a profound sense of alienation in our minds.", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Fyodor Dostoyevsky ' s Nineteenth century novella \" Notes from Underground \" and the plot of this twenty first century movie carry identical messages .

After a harrowing and kind of funny plane flight with tundra pilot Brian Dennehy government researcher Tyler is dropped in the frozen middle of nowhere.  It's a `kind of' funny plane flight because it's so well done.  Dennehy is a hung over, buckaroo bonzai type independent flyer.  His little prop plane, heavily laden with Tyler's (Charles Martin Smith) equipment, has a tough time both taking off and, later, staying afloat.  The in-flight repairs Dennehy makes had me on the edge of my seat - although the photography is the great strength of NEVER CRY WOLF, the acting - especially by Smith - and the editing are also nearly perfect. As harrowing as the plane ride is it's a pretty safe bet the plane will land (elsewise there'd be no movie) and Tyler will find survival, rather than research, is the pressing order of business.\n\n Tyler is there to locate a wild wolf pack, kill one or two of the pack members, and dissect them to discover if, as suspected, their stomachs contain an inordinate amount of healthy caribou meat.  Tyler, laden with crates of light bulbs and toilet paper, is materially and constitutionally unprepared for setting up a research station on his own.  Fortunately for him he'll be discovered, rescued, and befriended by two Inuits - the ancient Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq) and his adopted son, Mike (Samson Jonah.)  As Tyler notes in his voice-over narration, there are no orphans among the Inuit.  Ootek and Mike will arrive and disappear a few times, a wolf pack will be found, and Tyler will learn that man's relationship to the wolf is many times more complex than he imagined.\n\n I dislike most message movies.  They tend to distort characters and events, and beat you over the head until you accept their point of view.  NEVER CRY WOLF has a strong message about man and nature, but it's such an entertaining movie I didn't feel like I needed to join the Sierra Club to enjoy it.  The story lines are clear, and after the plane trip its plentiful humor is quiet and unforced.  Smith, who spends an awful lot of the movie alone, acting under his voice-over narration, is nuanced and convincing.
