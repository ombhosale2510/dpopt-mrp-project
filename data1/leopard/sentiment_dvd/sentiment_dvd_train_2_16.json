Auto Focus tells the story of Bob Crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess.\n\nWhen the film opens, Bob (Greg Kinnear, in a fantastic performance) is about to hit the big time, and is a loving family man who doesn't drink or smoke. He attends mass on Sundays. One day on the set of Hogan's Heroes, though, his life begins to take a bit of a turn when he meets John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a techno-guy with all the latest gadgets, including video equipment, which fascinates Crane.\n\n\"Carp\" opens the door for Bob to unleash his inner desires, which both excite and frighten him. It begins innocently enough, sitting in on the drums at a strip club, but eventually Bob loses all self-control and ends up making pornographic videos of his exploits and frequently \"swinging.\" All the while Bob refuses to admit that there's anything wrong with him; if you ask him, he'll tell you he's just a normal guy.\n\nAfter Hogan's Heroes came to an end, Crane took a job with a dinner theatre show, which allowed Crane and Carp to take their liaisons on a traveling show. As Crane's indiscretions get worse, his personal life deteriorates, as he divorces two wives (played by Rita Wilson and Mario Bello).\n\nAuto Focus has been expertly directed by Paul Schrader, who begins the film with bright, glossy colors, then as Crane goes deeper and deeper into his obsessions, the colors fade and the camera becomes unstable, just as Crane does.

The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role.\n\nThis movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.\n\nThis movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie).\n\nTrue science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy.\n\nThis movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like \"Scanners\", \"Videodrome\", and the 1986 remake of \"The Fly\"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.)\n\nBesides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.  \n\nIn spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.

The plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as \"well-worn,\" which seems to be a euphemism for \"shop-worn,\" \"clich\ufffd,\" or \"stupefyingly unoriginal.\" Here it is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir, heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it. Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz, throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career, publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs. (Speaking of whom: \"As It Is In Heaven\" was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the k\ufffdttbullar?) \n\nA standard feature of movies like this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade of didactic marionettes includes:\n\n-- Daniel's love interest, a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force;\n\n-- the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern Scandinavia;\n\n-- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It;\n\n-- the retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir, chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People. (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence, or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I can recall seeing is \"Best Boy,\" a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in \"There's Something About Mary,\" or turned into plaster saints as here.) \n\nSo, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of \"The O.C.\"  Run, don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main attraction.

In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, \"The Descent\"\n\n\"The Descent\" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.\n\nAt the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.\n\nEven though \"The Descent\" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.\n\n\"The Descent\" is unrated and contains violence and language", "label": "positive", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co - workers in regards to movies to watch , at least when it comes to the horror genre .

This means that anything he tells you is suspect, anything he gives you is suspect, and he probably has the power to make you believe in him. Yikes. Not a safe trip. Not a terribly sane trip, for that matter.\n\nYet that is precisely what Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) desired. He had one copy of \"The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow\", and there were three extant. One or all of these books is a forgery, and one or all holds the secret to summoning Satan. He hires Corso (played a bit too understated by Johnny Depp) to research the other texts.\n\nThe movie is based on the novel \"The Club Dumas\" by Arturo Perez Reverte, which I favorably reviewed.\n\nI can't give a similar review to The Ninth Gate for a number of reasons. First, Depp's portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore.\n\nA mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating supernatural abilities. We are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping Corso, or in what her abilities might have been (never mind her identity). Yet since this is a character from the book, I know why she was there, I have a pretty good idea who she was (and good job to the author on how he handled that!) and her character's interests and abilities could have been better communicated, with very little difficulty.\n\nAlso, in a rather silly departure from the book (departures are fine...I'm not being a book snob), they substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall, white, and physically imposing. There's nothing that irritates me more than a \"quota substitute\". I don't think this particular sub had any speaking lines, which makes it that much more of an insult.\n\nI love intelligent thrillers. (I didn't care for The Da Vinci Code.) This was a thriller that spent time in libraries, that examined woodcuttings drawn, perhaps, by Lucifer himself - yet I wasn't engaged.\n\nIn 1999, when the film was released, I couldn't sit through it. After reading The Club Dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two, I approached the film again, hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help. It did not. In fact, it raised more questions.\n\nI would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3; however, I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD gets a big spanking for not having subtitles.

Seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of Chicago, they move to Seattle.  Eighteen months later, Jonah can sense that his dad is still sad; and, in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on Christmas Eve to wish for his father a new wife.  Annie Reed lives in Baltimore and is engaged to Walter.  Their relationship, while loving and comfortable, is entirely devoid of romantic sparks.  When Annie hears Jonah's soulful plea on the radio, it's as if her heart has been touched by \"magic\" and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to Sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across \"like 26 states\".\n\nThe critique ...\nSleepless in Seattle is a brilliantly simple film; that's what makes it so great.  To quote Nora Ephron, \"It isn't a movie about love, it's a movie about love in the movies.\"  To emphasize this point, she incorporates various parallel references to \"An Affair to Remember\" throughout the film; but, Sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love (which, let's admit it, have been undeniably shaped by what we've seen on the silver screen).  The script is refreshingly candid, yet endearing and Nora Ephron's direction is impeccable.  Ross Malinger, cast as Jonah Baldwin, is the youngest and most notable talent in the film.  He does an excellent job of portraying THE quintessential eight-year-old; he's impulsive, moody and thinks he knows it all.  (I speak from experience here folks; I currently have a son that age.)  He and Tom Hanks come together flawlessly as father and son; so successfully in fact, that they would be utterly convincing off screen.  The chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks is equally amazing, which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene.  The supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman, Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner, David Hyde Pierce, and a young Gaby Hoffmann.  Families with younger children will appreciate the film's integrity; there is very little foul language (\"God damn it\" and \" ... it scared the shit out of me ...\" being the worst of it) and no \"sexual content\" to be wary of.  All around, this is a winning film.  One that I find myself watching over and over and over again.\n\nThe DVD ...\nFor a 10th Anniversary Edition, the special features are few and rather disappointing.  You've got your basic director commentary, a music video (\"When I Fall in Love\" by Celine Dion & Clive Griffin), and a \"Love in the Movies\" Featurette.  This last piece is approximately 15 minutes long.  It features the director, producers,\tactors and the hosts of Loveline: Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla (why they are included, I don't know) talking about \"Love in the Movies.\"  There are some interesting interview segments with an Empire State Building Historian and some very beautiful shots of the New York skyline before 9/11; but there's certainly nothing here to write home about.
