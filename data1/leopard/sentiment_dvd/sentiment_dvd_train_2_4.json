[{"sentence1": "For those not aware, Pumpkinhead 2 is (supposedly) the 1994 sequel to 1988's timeless monster classic, Pumpkinhead. The original was darkly creepy, superbly constructed in it's story, and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature. Pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific, butchers the story, and basically uses the name and a simliar creature-suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant \"sequel\". It's like a group of writers saw a picture of Pumpkinhead on the internet, read his name (and that's ALL they read), and decided to make their own movie. As for the plot (if anyone cares), a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings. I'll admit, if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie, this would've been worth two or three stars as a \"so bad it's good\" B flick. But the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it. If you haven't seen 1988's Pumpkinhead, rent it or buy it -- it's a horror masterpiece (especially compared to this) with so much going for it. But avoid this sequel at all costs.

The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role.\n\nThis movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.\n\nThis movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie).\n\nTrue science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy.\n\nThis movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like \"Scanners\", \"Videodrome\", and the 1986 remake of \"The Fly\"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.)\n\nBesides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.  \n\nIn spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.  I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture.", "label": "negative", "processed_sent": "[CLS] David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King ' s novel , and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith ( no middle initial ) .
