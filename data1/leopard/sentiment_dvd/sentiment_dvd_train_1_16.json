This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards.\n\n \"Spun\" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in \"American Beauty\"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy). \n\n I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit,  who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead.\n\nThis is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas \ufffdkerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like.\n\nI'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days.

Whatever. I saw his 1974 film THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY for the first time recently, and I immediately fell in love with it. There are those who swear by his more popular 1972 Oscar-winner THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, but somehow I think THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is even more entertaining than DISCREET CHARM.\n\nThere is no plot to speak of in PHANTOM: this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds Buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images. Monks pray for a woman's sick father, and then play poker with the woman and smoke. A group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets, and go to the bathroom to eat in private. Two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter---even though she's right there in class when they call her name. In the universe Buuel concocts in THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY, anything goes.\n\nThe amazing thing about this movie is that, instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches, THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY has a broad theme to support its free-form structure: it's Buuel's comic vision of freedom run amuck. Sure, the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but, as Buuel seems to be suggesting, even freedom has its limits. The opening scene of the movie is set in Toledo, Spain in 1808, as Napoleon's troops attempt to liberate the Spanish and are greeted with cries of \"Down with liberty!\" There can be times when we want the assurance of authority, rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please.\n\nBuuel doesn't take a stand one way or the other, really; he's just an artist who is intrigued by the idea, and his interest fuels the free-form structure of the film, and its content. Almost anything and everything he can think of---within the bounds, I suppose, of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career---is thrown into this movie, and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure, I found its elegant chaos exhilarating. \n\nOnly a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this. I think Buuel pulls it off triumphantly here; somehow, he makes the movie seem almost logical, the way it progresses. THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is a sheer delight.

After hearing that this was a Christian movie, I could not wait to watch it. However, this movie has nothing in common with Christianity, quite the contrary, this is the most anti-Christian movie that I have ever seen; it promotes murder and other unsurpassable evil. \n\nThe movie started out horribly and just continued to get worse. For instance, the beginning of the movie was shockingly pornographic. In a supposedly \"Christian\" movie I did not expect to be bombarded with this. After seeing this I did not expect that the movie could possibly get worse. However, I was greatly mistaken. Later in the movie the main character, who was remarkably unsympathetic, met several of her Christian co-workers who were talking about something they called \"the pearl dream.\" Intrigued, the main character asked them what this dream was. Of course, they were unable to answer because it is complete nonsense. None the less, the main character continues to review what her co-workers have told her about Christianity over the years. As the movie plods along, generally confusing and boring the viewer, she comes to the decision to give up her sinful lifestyle and turn to God. When this event transpired I assumed, wrongly, that from this point forward the film would redeem its beginning and maybe even say something good about Christianity. This, however, is where the movie went form being merely bad to astoundingly  sacrilegious. \n\nThen, the main character and her young daughter set out for the desert. Due to a vague dream, they believed that this was God's will and that He would appear in the desert and take them to heaven, in other words \"rapture\" them. How they came to this assumption I was never quite sure. The movie often made ludicrous statements  which never made the slightest amount of sense. I became extremely weary trying to deduce what was happening. Nothing that took place in this movie was remotely Biblical nor was it well explained. \n\nAs time passed our characters continued to sit in the desert, boring the viewer to tears. They begin to suspect that God was not coming to gather them to heaven and they started to despair. This is where the movie became intolerably anti-Christian; the mother took her daughter up to a mountain and asked her to kneel. She then forced her daughter to pray. After the prayer was concluded she took a gun from her dress and shot her crying daughter, supposedly to send her to heaven. She \"believes\" that she is doing God's will. Obviously, she was such an idiot that she failed to read that the Bible that strictly forbids murder. Afterwards, she is sent to prison, where we hope to see her suffer for her cruel, viscous, and insurmountably stupid act. As she is sitting in her cell, blaming God for the murder of her daughter, that she willingly committed (If she had half a brain cell she would have realized that she was doing Satan's will, not God's), she hears trumpets and the cell walls start to fall in. A few scenes pass, in which the ghost of her daughter returns and tries to redeem her faith. She, however, refuses. Then, she is taken to a dark room, that the viewer is supposed to believe is some supernatural place where judgment takes place, and asks if she loves God. She replies no, because she blames Him for her insanity. The film concludes with her standing stupidly in a dark room, that failed to represent eternity. \n\nMost of the aspects included in the film were never explained. Such as the significance of \"the pearl dream.\" Nor was it explained why they believed that they needed to wait in the desert. How did they contrive this ridiculous idea from a vague, ambiguous, and utterly vapid dream anyway? None of these questions were ever answered. This caused the film to feel incomplete. The stories between scenes shifted so drastically that I suspected I had missed several important scenes. After checking my DVD I realized that I had not accidentally skipped crucial scenes, because their were none. This film was deliberately ambiguous and vapid. \n\nAlso, the special effects, cinematography, and acting were about as good as a preschool play. None of the actors put any emotion into their roles. They recited their lines like drugged zombies; I suppose even they realized it was complete rubbish and decided not to put much effort into it. \n\nTo state the obvious, this film is a disgrace! Obviously, it is not Biblically based. It does NOT represent Christian philosophy which is to love others, not to wander around aimlessly in the desert acting like a fool. Nor do Christians promote murder, as this film implied. This movie has as much religious value as Night of the Blind Nazi Zombies. I am ashamed to see that such a complete travesty is labeled a Christian film. This film is extremely anti-Christian; its main objective is to give the world the false impression that fundamentalist Christians are brainwashed and are incapable of sane thoughts. This is not true, and yes, I can prove it. All the proof that you need is contained in the Bible. If you stop hardening your heart and truly listen with an open mind then you cannot help but to see Jesus loving message for the world. He does not desire to bring misery to the world, but happiness and love. The reason that there is misery in the world is because people, like those who made this film, disobey God. If we followed His loving rules then we would not suffer. I do not write this rather long review out of hatred, as I am sure many will accuse me of. I write this to warn people what this movie is really about. It is not a true Christian movie like the Left Behind's and The Passion of the Christ.  And, yes I am aware that I will be bombarded by a slough of negative votes. However, I do not even faintly care. My beliefs, as a fundamentalist Christian and my love of God  is more important to me than a  number on a page.\n\nAlso, I was shocked to read the other reviews on this forum, especially the one from the Wiccan woman who said that she wished to see Christians thrown to the lions as they were in the time of the Romans. I have seen a lot of hatred in my life but her review was by far the worst I have ever see. Christians love the world and those in it, we do not tell non-Christians about Christ to imply that we are \"holier than thou\" because we are not. All are equal under God's eyes. We are all sinners and the only way to attain redemption is to accept God's undeserved grace. We tell other people about God's undeserved love because we want to save them and see them living in eternal joy in Heaven. We do not rejoice to see people unsaved, we tell them about their condition because we want to see them saved. In other words, we tell people because we love them. Also, for those of you who accuse Christians of having a hatred of the world, why do you spew hatred in everything you say toward Christians? Aren't you displaying the hatred that you claim you abhor?\n\nIn conclusion, this is the worst movie ever made. It is anti-Christian, immensely sacrilegious, poorly acted, poorly written, vapid, mind numbingly dull, disjointed, tortuously long, etc. In short, this film is an abomination. It is massively offensive to Christians and is a massive misrepresentation of Christian values. Also, the acting is abysmal and the story line hopelessly confusing. If you wish to watch a film that accurately portrays Christian values then I recommend watch \"The Passion of the Christ\" or the Left Behind movies.  I hope that this review will help you; it was written with love and concern. I shall keep you in my prayers.

Many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us.

Honestly it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't worth all the worship that the Hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either. The story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers, only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of Ed Harris , who in my opinion had the best performance overall. Ed (Mr. Fogarty) is in the Mob and seems to think that Viggo (Tom) is Joey Cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge. Tom, and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) have two children, a farmhouse, and a diner and Tom insist that he isn't Joey. The story goes on, dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex. Maria Bello has never been one of my favorite actresses, I think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair (evidence is in the movie) she brings the level of believability down and makes Viggo's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent. We soon figure out that Tom is indeed Joey and after we say goodbye to Ed Harris's character (of which I was just disappointed to see, c'mon he was awesome!) Tom/Joey goes to see his brother, Richie (William Hurt) to make amends for disappearing, and soon realizes that Richie wants him dead. So more killing, more blood, and tom/joey is finally free of his past, if his family would take him back. Of course they do, really, his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table (his daughter sets a place for him...) and the movie is over. There was no Aha moment, the action wasn't anything new, the story was predictable and the setting was \"been there done that\". Viggo is an amazing actor, and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the Tom/Joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into, the shift of reality was barely noticeable. Maria Bello, needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough, sexy, stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly, it doesn't work for her, she cannot pull it off.
