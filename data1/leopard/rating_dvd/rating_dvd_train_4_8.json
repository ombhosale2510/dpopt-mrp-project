Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true.\n\n`Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon.\n\nIf you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the \"Ocean of Fire\".\n\nHighly Recommended", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Surprisingly ` Hidalgo ' released in ' 04 didn ' t live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings , or audience appeal .
