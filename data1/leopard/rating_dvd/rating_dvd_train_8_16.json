The story is rambling and confused, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what story they wanted to tell. The animation is very average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes. In fact, those all-important \"happy feet\" of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit. (That's supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be \"animation?\") The jokes aren't particularly funny (with the exception of a few moments in the middle where Robin Williams briefly shines). And oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing, there's not a single original song, or even an inspired remake of any of the songs. Think \"Billy Elliot\" meets \"The March of the Penguins\" with some  of Gore's \"An Inconvenient Truth\" mixed in--without any of the wit, charm, intelligence, passion, or beauty in any of those films. (Did I mention that this film is a disaster?)\n\nPerhaps most annoyingly, like the rest of the story, the underlying political message alternates between cliched, confused, and heavy-handed. The ending is especially unbearable, with its tacked-on feel and absurd psuedo-environmentalist feel-good solution. What a joke! Personally, I consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions (I've been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, and a member of Sierra Club and PETA, for example), yet the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me greatly--not least because of the utter inconsistency and incomprehensibility of the message.\n\nOne final note for those of you with children: this is not really a kids movie. Most of the jokes won't be understood by children under 15. For kids under 6, all this feeble film offers is some too-scary \"Shamus\" (orcas), a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth, and a jarring ending that suddenly switches to live-action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid-friendly forums as the United Nations!

She's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers. Her voice is sturdy, durable, indestructible.\n\nBut oh my God, her acting choices ... She and the Indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film (whereas Buffalo Bill, allegedly a larger-than-life character, looks like a corpse by comparison, and Howard Keel, in only his second film, must manage to act like these are human beings he's relating to). \n\nTake a look at Betty Hutton's reaction upon seeing Howard Keel for the first time -- the mugging would be considered \"a bit much\" if seen from the back row of an amphitheater. At best, her performance is clownlike; at worst, it's apelike. Little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity. It's a magnificent effort, and a stunning testimony to her desire to please, but her comedy has no reality, no nuance, no connection to any sincere emotion. She seizes on \"hick\" and drives that into the ground, then she plays nothing but \"infatuated\" for a while before toggling to \"resentful\" and so forth ... It's a series of masks and set pieces, but it's not a character. Judy Garland was in sad shape at that point in her life, but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind Annie's rootin'-tootinest moments, and she wouldn't have neglected Annie's grit even in the melting sentimental scenes. Nobody can do vulnerability like Judy, and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors -- both qualities that would serve this character. Annie could be a wonderful character, a great self-conflicted mess of strength, longing, guts, femininity, skill, naivete and worldiness, all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man -- but instead Betty Hutton makes her a pop-eyed, crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet. I am surprised that Hutton didn't insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out. Maybe they just wouldn't let her. The scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh, oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide. \n\nI kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on, and the memory of Betty Hutton's performance is branded on my brain, but it's because this performance seems like it's following the traditions of some other culture, some other world. It's like going to a sideshow.\n\nThat said, the tunes are a non-stop parade of hits -- there probably isn't any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another, in wildly different styles, with effective melodies worth remembering. The classic tunes just keep coming. The movie works as spectacle and songfest, and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness.

First off, the movie is almost three hours long (172 minutes) and if you're going to have a movie that long...It better be damned good. Well, overall, Heat has it's ups and downs (and scenes that could've been edited out); But it's a pretty good film. Pacino plays Vincent Hanna, an LAPD cop who's detached from his wife and stepdaughter (Natalie Portman) because he spends all his time tracking down criminals. On the flipside of the coin is Neil McCauley (De Niro), who distances himself from relationships in order to continue on his life of crime. Neil runs crime oufits and orchestrates heists and he's pretty good too. Val Kilmer ('The Doors') plays Chris Shiherlis, Neil's friend and semi-partner. The movie is kind of your typical cop and robber thriller. There are some differences and stuff I haven't seen in the typical film. Scenes like when Vincent has coffee with Neil, when he knows Neil is planning a bank robbery is cool. The movie's cast is huge and features big names. Some of them include, Jon Voight ('Midnight Cowboy'), Tom Sizemore ('Natural Born Killers'), Amy Brenneman ('Judging Amy'), Ashley Judd ('Double Jeopardy'), Mykelti Williamson ('Lucky Number Slevin'), Jeremy Piven ('Entourage'), Ted Levine ('The Hills Have Eyes'), William Fichtner ('Prison Break'), Hank Azaria ('Along Came Polly'), Danny Trejo ('Spy Kids' who's playing a role that was clearly written for him. The character is named Trejo), Tone Loc (the rapper), Henry Rollins (the Black Flag frontman), and more. The biggest flaw I saw in the movie was the fact that it digs too much into Vincent and Neil's personal lives. Most heist movies present the cop and the robber, rather than explain them. In that aspect, it was cool of Michael Mann to try something different and mix it up a little bit. Problem is, I was more interested in what Neil's plans were and what Vincent was going to do about it than I was about intimacy/relationship issues.

One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.  \n\nFirstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina.  Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to \"purify\" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is \"preserve the Aryan race.\"  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.\n\nYes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single \"good\" thing about this movie would have been \"discovered/invented\" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.  \n\nThey say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a \"hero\" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.  \n\nIn conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the \"techniques\" that this film claims to have \"discovered\" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.  So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess", "label": "2", "processed_sent": "[CLS] A French saying goes : \" The more things change , the more they stay the same . \" It appears that the \" historical \" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that \" poetic \" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth . One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith ' s emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth .

The film is composed of three segments and each tells the story of three families live on the same street. One house has a father who is uncertain of his parental abilities and is almost afraid to bond with his son. The other is a strong, distant and harsh man who is unfaithful in marriage and can't come to terms with his gay son. The third father is a failure in life who seemingly resents the success of his son. Overall the plots do not intervene with the exception of two sons who are childhood friends. \n\nEach story is told independently. The first story involves a father son relationship between a man named Anthony and his son Nick. The story line is rather predictable. Father loves son but doesn't know how to relate. Things change when the mother dies and the pair grow somewhat closer, but the essence of the relationship does not change. This keeps it from slipping into the realm of the predictable where father and son would instantly bond. The second story is probably the strongest of the three sections involving a hard father figure in the person of  Gene and his son Tom. The fact that Tom is gay is probably not the reason he is estranged from his father. Gene is such a hard character it would be difficult for anyone to be close to him, which makes the unashamed attitude of Tom all the more believable. Gene reenters his son's life at a time he desperately needs him, and the results are surprising and again not clich. The story that could get very predictable is the third segment where a father named Noah is visited shortly before his death by his successful son Elliot. Noah is a shell of a man throughout his life and his difficulties are revealed in the segment.\n\nThe film does not explore any new ground in father/son relationships, and at times comes too close to relying on stereotypes, still it is interesting and worthwhile. The fact that it is well acted and moves along helps too.", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] FATHERS AND SONS is a film that attempts to explore the complex relationships between fathers and sons .
