Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes!\n\nThe basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry.

The Painted Lady is one of the more innovative, compelling and consistently intriguing English mysteries to be produced by the Masterpiece set. Though this addition to the Masterpiece Theatre collection will appeal to devotees of the series, there are enough original elements here to win the kinds of viewers who may be turned off by some of the stuffier BBC productions.  This one, while staid enough to keep the loyalists, is also hip enough to win a new legion of followers.  \n\nLike many English mysteries this one examines not crime so much as social relationships and this glimpse into the mysteries of British class and character is one of the most interesting that I've seen. Helen Mirren plays \"Maggie Sheridan\", a British Isles pop star whose bluesy-rock voice tinged with just the right amount of Celtic grandeur made her one of the biggest stars of the sixties and early seventies but due to a combination of hard-living and bad relationship choices she went from star to down and outer virtually overnight. Lucky for her, longtime family friend Sir Charles Stafford and his son Sebastian allowed her to crash in a cottage on their family estate when she hit rock bottom and its there that she has been sitting out the last two decades (the 80's & 90's) of her life. When we first see Maggie she seems to be wearing the same hairstyle and clothes she probably wore twenty years earlier and she just seems to be driftin' from one day to the next in a kind of drug & alcohol induced has-been haze livin' a care free & rent free life with her musician boyfriend.  But then something wakes her up.\n\nOne night art thieves break into the main house and Sir Charles Stafford is murdered while trying to prevent them from stealing the one treasure that is sacred to him: the portrait of his dead wife. Sir Charles' death disgusts Maggie; it stirs her out of her nostalgic haze and opens her eyes to contemporary realities. When the police fail to catch the thieves Maggie decides to take matters into her own hands. Though this miniseries is ostensibly about Maggie's attempt to hunt down a murderer the real excitement is in watching Maggie transform her life. She goes from looking and acting like a cultural refugee held captive by the rememberance of things past into an international mover and shaker who is as intrigued with her own untapped potentials and newly discovered freedom as we are. If she is to succesfully infiltrate the international art community and catch Sir Charles's killer Maggie must not only learn about art history and the ins and outs of the art market but she must don an entirely new persona (as an eastern European countess no less). Maggie not only takes to her new identity but she really seems to come to life in this new role she's fashioned for herself; it's as if she has finally found a role that gives her life meaning, purpose, and direction and she actually enjoys playing it. Once \"Maggie\" the folkie drop-out becomes \"Magdelena\" the art dealer/detective there is no limit to what she is capable of. Mirren accomplishes the near impossible task of making this transformation seem believable. She does such a good job at playing both Maggie/Magdalena that we never really question it but only marvel at the fact that some people can and do change.  \n\n Maggie's transformation into Magdelena occurs against an ever-changing backdrop of social settings not one of which seems to shake the versatile Maggie/Magdelena who seems to inherently know how to act in all situations. Through her eyes we get a glimpse of every imaginable social space and every imaginable social type. Only Helen Mirren could make it seem so natural to be so many different things to so many different people.  When Maggie is living on the estate we see her relate to her musician boyfriend in one way and to Sir Charles in another, when she goes to London we see her relate with her gentrified bourgeois sister in one way and her sister's husband in another, and when we see her in New York City we see her relate with international art connoisseur Robert Tassi (played by Franco Neri) in one way and in quite another way with ex-flame Eddie Mullen (played by Roland Gift) .  And every performance is seamless. Mirren makes it seem like her character is not conflicted in the least but is simply a facinating myriad-minded individual who inhabits the world in her own way.  \n\nMaggie/Magdelena's most fascinating attribute may just be her ability to see through the haze of class that seems to blind everyone else.  English mysteries are almost always about the license and liberties of the upper crust and the envy of those less fortunate and this series is no exception. The Masterpiece Theatre lens loves to gaze upon impossibly posh estates and their impossibly posh inhabitants as they go about their business within rooms littered with historical paintings and artifacts but that lens is also very curious and it loves to have a look in to the musty old closets and attics and graveyards as well. The secrets contained within those dark spaces show that the markers of social class are invaribaly superficial and that two things are always certain: 1) that the life of the cultured is never as far removed from the life of the streets as the cultured would like to think, and, 2) that the social markers of wealth and cultivation and high living are also invariably markers of moral and ethical compromise and decay. Maggie/Magdelena is fascinating and she succeeds magnificently precisely because she is comfortable with both of these truths which would unnerve most others. \n\nDuring Maggie/Magdelena's investigation of Sir Charles' murder she must negotiate the art world and the underworld and ultimately she finds that they are each populated by equally seedy types. Occupying a middle ground between these two extremes is the gentrified bourgeois who like to imagine that they are part of an incorruptible majority, but the landed gentry (the middle-aged professionals) just come off as self-deluding hypocrits in this clever mystery which is, among other things, a critique of the habits and practices of each echelon of the social world. If Maggie/Magdelena fares better than most by stories end its because she knows the world better than most as a result of her having inhabited so many roles and seen the world from so many different angles.  So although the plot of this film is rather mandarin (the \"Sebastian\" sub or co-plot intrigues and frustrates in equal measures; and the critique of the aristocracy and its self-serving alliances may seem overwrought) its really only a minor distraction in an otherwise immensely enjoyable and remarkably well conceived study of character and class.\n\nThis is a Masterpiece Theatre that is hip to contemporary social realites and thus current & relevant. Plus Helen Mirren has never given a more versatile and more interesting performance. Her character defies the idea that a person's character is defined by class and her character defies the idea that a person must have only one character.

Appearing in the film is Jeremy Theobald, who appeared in Nolan's first feature short, Doodlebug (1997), Lucy Russell, who is going to appear in Nolan's take on the Gotham Knight in 2005's Batman Begins, and Alex Haw, who has no other credits, which is too bad as I thought he did very well here.\n\nTheobald plays Bill, an aspiring writer (i.e. the starving artist type...you know him...greasy, unkempt, living in a shabby apartment subsisting off macaroni and ketchup...or is it catsup?  I guess it doesn't matter) whose curiosities have developed into a rather odd compulsion of picking people out of the crowd, randomly, and following them with no other reason than to see where they go...I guess it beats working.  Anyway, after Bill gets caught `doing his thing' by one of his subjects, a slick, smartly dressed man named Cobb (Haw), he learns the man is a burglar, the two develop a sort of partnership, and Bill begins tagging along with Cobb (who seems to have an awful lot of insight about those who he robs), supposedly to gather information for his writing...but soon Bill finds himself not only learning, but participating, using the tricks of the trade taught to him as Cobb becomes the mentor, Bill the student.  Bill also becomes involved with the occupant of one of the flats the two have burglarized, a pretty blonde woman (Russell) with a somewhat shady past and a penchant for manipulation.  So what happens next?  Well, let's just say once you begin your downward decent, regardless of the illicit activity, the momentum generally takes hold and becomes a force of its' own, and not stopping until confronted with an immovable object, in this case, rock bottom.\n\nSo what the heck did I mean when I referred earlier to Nolan's mental state?  The story seems pretty straightforward, from the way I described it, right?  If you've seen the film Memento, you'll have a better understanding about what I'm talkin' about, Willis.  The story is straightforward, when played in the linear, chronological sense, but that's not the case here.  The film begins in the present, with the Bill relating his story to what appears to be a police detective, and then bounces between three different timeframes, the past, the not so distance past, and the present, highlighted by noticeable physical changes in Bill (hairstyles, facial hair, distinguishing bruises and cuts on his face...Bill gets the beating at one point).  Now, this might make the story sound confusing and hard to follow, but I didn't think so as Nolan seemed to know exactly how to best put things in the order without actually putting them back in order (if that makes sense).  As I said before, he does allow for variances to become the key indicators between the various timeframes, so if you're paying attention, you shouldn't have problems keeping up.  The story, when told in chronological order, is actually pretty simplistic, but Nolan manages to complicate things just enough to keep you in the dark right up until the end.  It is strange how much different the same story can play out depending on how it's told.  As I said, Nolan seems to be able to extract the most out of his skewed chronology of events, heightening the tension greatly.  The whole notion of understanding a story enough to completely tear it apart, re-assembling it in a completely different fashion, ultimately getting the same ending though a different route, and doing it successfully, is amazing.  The film, which was shot in black and white, is kept minimal (i.e. sparse) in nearly all aspects (script, story, characters, etc.), and runs lean and mean with a runtime of about 70 minutes.  There seems little, if anything, in the film that was unnecessary, so there's little to distract from the story.  Bottom line is if you're interested in a sharp, smartly paced film that wastes little and requires a bit of thought from its' viewer, Following won't disappoint.\n\nThe full screen picture (aspect ratio 1.33:1) looks gritty, serving to give the film a `noir-ish' quality, which accentuates the story well.  The 2.0 Dolby stereo is adequate, but there are English subtitles if you have difficulty hearing all the dialogue.  There are a whole slew of extras including commentary by director Nolan, the ability to reconstruct the film into chronological order, theatrical trailers for this film and Memento, second angles with the director's shooting script, along with cast and crew biographies.  I was surprised to learn Nolan was directing the next Batman film, Batman Begins, as it doesn't seem like the kind of thing he'd be interested in, but then many had preconceived ideas when it was announced Tim Burton was going to do a Batman film way back in 1989, and that didn't turn out too bad.\n\nCookieman108", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] After watching Following ( 1998 ) last night , I ' ve determined that writer / director Christopher Nolan , who would later do the immensely popular film Memento ( 2000 ) , is either a raving psychotic , mad genius , or possibly equal parts of both ( I ' ll elaborate more on this later ) .

They are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry, but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents.\n\nThe ruling moral code restricts Deanie more than Bud who ends up cavorting with a good-time girl named Juanita. The indiscretion overwhelms Deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state. A few years later with their lives on divergent paths, they meet again to come to terms with each other. While the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to Kazan's sure hand and William Inge's screenplay (his first directly for the screen), it's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue. Otherwise, there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955's \"Picnic\" based on Inge's successful Broadway play.\n\nAt her most beautiful, Wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned. As the none-too-bright Bud, Warren Beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes Deanie's powerful fixation completely understandable. There are several standout performances among the supporting cast with Audrey Christie pitch-perfect as Deanie's unsympathetic mother, Pat Hingle in blowhard mode as Bud's power-hungry father, and Zohra Lampert as Angie, the self-effacing waitress Bud meets at Yale.

Bush, Craig Wasson) is just a touch more professional.\n\nThe film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we can't see just how fake it looks.\n\nI don't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with; other, similar titles include \"Python\" 1 and 2, \"Anaconda\" (the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997) and \"Anaconda: Search for the Blood Orchid\", and the inevitable \"Boa Vs. Python\".\n\nThe DVD includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors.\n\n2/", "label": "2", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Another film in the never - ending series of \" Giant Animated Snake Eats People \" films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade .

We've already seen the claustrophobic, booming power of being trapped in an underwater submarine. That this movie is able to make that closeness even more powerful - and draw us into a story that really grips you with its meaning - is rather impressive. \n\nWe begin with two powerhouses of actors, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. Gene is in charge of the sub; Denzel works for him. Gene is an unabashed alpha male, not unheard of in a commander. Denzel is intelligent and respects the chain of command. Suddenly, we're thrown into a situation where the sub *might* have been ordered to launch a missile attack on an enemy to protect the US. Unfortunately, the sub can't get confirmation. So either they shoot and risk starting WWIII for no reason - or they fail to shoot and leave millions of people open to slaughter. \n\nThe plot and dialogue is incredible because it explores all the shades of grey in the characters. There's no right or wrong. Both scenarios are equally plausible. Gene wants to do what he was ordered to do, to save as many lives as he can. Denzel is desperate to get confirmation rather than risk mistakenly starting a world war. Both men suck up the men around them into their sides. Nobody WANTS the war. Gene doesn't take pleasure in firing - but he sees it as a necessary action to save lives. \n\nIn such close confines, every person on screen makes a huge difference. This movie had not only two stellar top men, but also a fantastic supporting cast. James Gandolfini a la Sopranos. Viggo Mortensen a la Lord of the Rings. The music from Hans Zimmer is just amazing. He is a genius and can give incredibly subtle nuances to his works. \n\nIf I had to find something to nit-pick in this movie, it's that I don't think the sub scenes were truly \"realistic\". It seemed more of a Hollywood sub than a real working piece of machinery that trained soldiers were living in for months. I think Das Boot did an exquisite job of getting that sense across. But really, the sub in this case was a \"set\" for the dialogue and character development to happen in. It wasn't the showcase, and this wasn't a sub documentary. So I'm willing to accept that tradeoff, so that we could have as tightly woven a story as we got.", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] This is a simply amazing movie , and what makes it even more stellar is that we ' ve had several fantastic submarine movies in the past - Das Boot and Red October come to mind .

The excellent acting of the cast gives depth to otherwise banal characters in such a way that suggests that they could have been different has they chosen otherwise.  I didn't particularly like the convenient and superfluous inclusion of UFOs in the storyline and thought it unnecessarily weakend an almost flawless plot line.
