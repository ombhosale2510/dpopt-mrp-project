I think this was made AFTER Gettysburg so any motivation of remorse couldn't have had much to do with \"Andersonville\"....\n\nAs a younger Civil War/War of Northern Aggression student, I read MacKinlay Kantor's book \"Andersonville\" and while there is much vile to see in this film, it does show why the written word is still the most powerful weapon in war.  Kantor's descriptions in writing defy depiction by even the most skilled set-dresser.  And nobody, I mean nobody, Federal or Confederate, officer or enlisted man, young or old can come out a situation such as Andersonville looking particularly well--and the post-liberation photographs show it, just as do the post-liberation photographs of Auschwitz, Dachau, and Bergen-Belsen.  The German film of the 1950s \"The Doctor of Stalingrad\" which purported to show conditions in a German POW camp in the Soviet Union after World War II, and the great film \"Hart's War\" depict relative Shangri-La conditions...\n\nFor someone who knows little about the POW situation during this great American conflict, I would recommend the DVD \"Andersonville\" but NOT in isolation.  It must be tempered with a rounded knowledge of conditions in Northern Camps--which DO appear on the History Channel regularly...and recognition that after prisoner exchange was discontinued, nothing short of genocide on a fairly grand scale could result.\n\nI recall a television documentary about the trial of the Andersonville Commander, whic starred of all people William Shatner--back in the 1970s or so...which I was quite impressed with and should be resurrected.  But for the present, films such as \"Andersonville\" are replete with underlying messages about the horrors of war, that humans make war and then complain about the conditions which are inevitable, and that despite our intelligence we have not found an alternative to it--yet.  If this film inspires one intellect to put his or her head to the solution of this problem, then there will be no more Andersonvilles....This film shows how easily humans who are civilized (we think) can descend into the psychosocial dynamics of the crowd, the group, the herd, plundering and devaluing of human life to that of mere livestock", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] After looking at some of the reviews , I ' ll admit I ' m a bit confused .

It's a good workout. Parts of it are more intense than others. It doesn't seem to really build in intensity - or - ebb and flow in intensity in a nice way. In other words the variance in intensity seems kind of haphazard. Karen Voight seems to plan waves of intensity to keep your heart rate up throughout most of the workout. This one doesn't seem to indicate that Kathy Smith was paying a lot of attention to that. \n\nThere are a lot of propulsion moves in this DVD. They use a special step that bows in when they jump on it. This workout takes advantage of that kind of step. I have a regular step which means some of the propulsion moves are a little more challenging for me. This DVD gives me some knee pain where others don't as much (it's the type of propulsion move, not the quanity, and it's time proximity to other propulsion moves).\n\nThe camera guys try to get very artsy; and so they do a LOT of cuts during transitions and at the beginning of new moves. This makes the steps much harder to learn and get under your belt.\n\nTo me, some of the step routines in the last set are a little boring. The last 12 minute set really seems to slow down. The first two 12 minute sets (after the warm-up) are more interesting and fun, more energizing. \n\nShe uses a lot of sudden, purposeful jumps onto the step. So for instance, you'll do this \"power hold\" where you forcefully jump up on the step on one foot. Kind of like hop-scotch. If you played hop-scotch slowly with a lot of purpose and made one big jump on one foot per hop-scotch square, paused, made another big jump on the other foot, paused, made another big jump on the opposite foot, and so on. So instead of normal propulsion moves where you are more light on your feet and switch feet more quickly, these power holds and other purposeful jumps are heavier, more targeted, and giving your leg/foot more shock", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] This DVID is about 50 minutes long .
