Four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named Dr. Von Doom (who wins the award for the Most Obvious Name for a Villain Ever); they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers (now we're talking) thanks to some chemical filled cloud. What follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history. Special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show. We get The Thing caving in the front of a semi-truck with his shoulder as the money shot, but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified. An entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers. But since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered, and succeed. Destruction for the fans, no consequences for the characters. But why would director Tim Story try anyways? He knows the people are just showing up to ogle at Jessica Alba as she pretends to act. So instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame. He should have just directed a Pepsi commercial with Jessica Alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess.\n\nThe plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining. Instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble. They aren't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie. They go out, show off their powers (in things like extreme sports, you know, for the kids), and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough. There is also a lackluster love triangle between Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Dr. Von Doom (Julian McMahon). I'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like Jessica Alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful, all wealthy Dr. Von Doom. But chances are if you're chasing someone that looks like her she's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career. So why is my rating so high above the zero I've been talking it up to be? Well it is what it is. It didn't put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly. It was fun watching TV actors such as Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon try their luck at a Hollywood blockbuster. And at least it wasn't \"Catwoman.\" But what it was was insulting. Beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe Jessica Alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid Story thinks we are.

Pennebaker's cameras.\n\nIf you're an aficionado of Broadway, you already know a lot about Sondheim. So, it's fascinating to see the young composer coaching his singers and consulting with the recording engineers during this marathon session from 1971. \n\nIt's a truly exciting and vibrant look at the process, shot entirely hand-held, with raw focusing and close ups on the vocalists. The performances are for the microphones, not the lenses, so you see quite a few candid moments throughout the evening, and this gives the film a heightened intensity, and even moreso because the whole thing runs just under an hour.\n\nStill, if you have played and played the cast album, it's very refreshing to see the alternate takes shown here. Dean Jones emoting on \"Being Alive\" is as incredible a performance as you'll ever view, and Elaine Stritch's \"Ladies Who Lunch\" recording is the lynchpin on which this whole film is hung.\n\nMy only complaint about this DVD is the \"commentary\" track. Granted, this commentary track was done particularly well. Some statements were clearly scripted, like the ones that filmmaker Pennebaker makes at the opening. Also commenting are Hal Prince, Broadway Director extraordinaire, who has some interesting insights and Elaine, the superstar diva, just being her gabby self. They carefully drop comments in where it doesn't take away from the original interview moments in the film, and there's a minimum of rambling, which is all too typical of such tracks on other DVDs. \n\nBut the fact is, this commentary track should have been a complete and separate interview section, perhaps gathering a few more of the participants, and sitting them down in a room for a chat. It would have been another chance for Pennebaker to roll more film in revisiting this alchemical moment in time.

In this review I'm not going to bother to review the movie itself. It's seventeen years old. I'm sure if you are interested in it you've seen it by now. Rather, I'm going to review the technical quality of the film and the extras provided on the DVD. One thing that feel I should point out up front is that the movie HAS been edited, but only in one scene. The infamous 'clergyman sporting an erection' that caused such a stupid flundie flap has been photoshopped. The theatrical poster artwork is not on the cover or anywhere on the disc for a similar reason. You can find out more by going to Snopes and looking in the Disney films section. I personally don't care, but some people do. Now, on to the review.\n\nThis version is widescreen, but it's 16:9 widescreen and not theatrical widescreen, but this has been the case in pretty much all the Disney movie DVDs so no surprises there. The Little Mermaid was the next to last movie Disney did using painted cels, and the film has gone through some kind of digital restoration process. There are comparison shots on the back of the DVD box that show the difference. The colors are very vibrant, and I didn't notice any problems with the encoding or animation. There is support for surround sound and audio tracks in English, French, and Spanish.\n\nIt's a two disk set. Disc one has the movie, the configuration options (subtitles, commentary, language ect), a music video of the song 'Kiss the Girl' by someone I've never heard of, a bunch of previews that will be outdated in a few months, and a preview of what's on disc 2. On the box it touts something called Fast Play, which basically means when you load it in, after the standard FBI warnings and all that, the disc gives you the option of immediately starting the movie or going to the menu with the stuff I just mentioned. If you choose to start the movie directly, it plays a bunch of previews that you can skip past using chapter forward on your remote, if you go to the menu and pick play movie, it starts right away. You're actually not forced to sit through ten minutes of BS previews with no way to skip them like on some of the previous Disney DVDs. I approve. \n\nThe majority of the extras are on disc 2. It's broken up into three major sections: Backstage Disney, Deleted Scenes, and Games. Backstage Disney is the largest section. It has scads of concept art (imagine Ursula as a lionfish or manta ray instead of an octopus), a videos on how the movie was made, and a new animated short, The Little Match Girl. A silent film with a musical background and is amazingly enough, actually true to the story. It's pretty well done, IMHO. Deleted scenes is just that, stuff that was cut. There really isn't much. Only three selections, and two of them are just pieces that were cut from scenes that did make it in. There's an expanded version of the opening song, a very short scene where Triton's daughters tell Sebastian that Ariel isn't at the recital before it starts, and an extra verse in Ursula's song. All of these were cut before the final animation was done, and so as you watch it switches back and forth between storyboard still shots and very rough sketchy animation. The games I didn't even bother with, because has there ever been a DVD player game that hasn't totally sucked? Didn't think so.\n\nOverall, it's going to boil down to how much you like the movie, and how much you hate minor edits. If not seeing Jessica Rabbit with no underwear for three frames bothered you, then this DVD is not for you. Otherwise, it is a comprehensive look at the movie that marked the beginning of Disney's second golden age. \n\nI give it 9 out of 10 voice containing seashells", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Finally got around to watching this last night .

White rabbit is a sawdust-stuffed real rabbit that escaped from the taxidermy stand, caterpillar is an old stocking with dentures and glass eyes, Mad Hatter is a marionette and March Hare is a wind-up stuffed toy rabbit with a loose button eye.  Devoted Alice fans may have a different reaction, but I found Jan Svankmajer's Alice disturbing and, at times, tedious.\n Everyday objects - the stuff in Alice's room - become the stuff of the dream.  Playing cards become Red Queen and entourage, the White Rabbit has a nasty looking set of incisors and a distressing tendency to shed his sawdust guts, Alice herself becomes her own blank-faced doll.  There's no law that says Alice has to be bright and cuddly, but it sure helps.  Whether intentional or not, Svankmajer's Alice is grim and nightmarish.  \n\nSvankmajer animates figures in motion- real figures, like dolls and stuffed and mounted rabbits and such - but he doesn't animate facial expressions.  Combine that with the flat tone of voice by the film's narrator - ALICE is narrated by the actress who plays Alice, dubbed into English, or course - and the film has a flat, dead feeling.  The film, oddly enough for an animated feature, is leadenly paced. Some scenes seem to run on forever.  The tea party with the Mad Hatter (a marionette) and the March Hare (a bedraggled plush toy bunny with an annoyingly ill-attached button eye) runs on and on, the animation repeating itself way past our limit of patience.  The Mad Hatter wants a new cup of tea (`Change chairs!'), the March Hare scoots around in a wheelchair.  The new seats are taken, the tea is poured, the Mad Hatter wants a news cup of tea (`Change chair!') and on, and on, and on.  Sheesh - thought that scene would never end.\n\n  Look - I'm not that big a fan of Carroll's Alice stories in the first place, but the movie adaptations of his stories - be they Disney's animated movie or the 1933 full-length feature with Ned Sparks as the Catepillar and Sterling Holloway as the frog - all have had something going for them.  Comedy, for one thing. Svankmajer's inspiration is laudable, but his execution is often disappointing.  His Alice is dark, grim, humorless and not everyone's cup of chai.    It's like listening to a quiet sonata played by an acid jazz band - it's familiar enough, probably good enough for the converted, but hard for the uninitiated to embrace and unlikely to win any new fans.", "label": "2", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Weird , whacked out interpretation of Lewis Carroll ' s Alice in Wonderland that combines live - action with some stop - action animation to create a creeped out dreamscape .

Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?) However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she? Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from?
