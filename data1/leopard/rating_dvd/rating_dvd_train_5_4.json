Her acting debut \"I'll Be There\" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so.\n\nSeventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl.\n\nThe problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because \"I'll Be There\" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting.\n\nWith a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills. \n\nThe best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church.\n\nMiss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. \"I'll Be There,\" but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can", "label": "2", "processed_sent": "[CLS] There ' s a reason why they talk about the \" Voice of an Angel \" - - it ' s because Charlotte Church certainly doesn ' t have the acting presence of one .

At first they can't stand each other, but they keep running into each other after years of never talking. They eventually become best friends and the previous question is put into play.\n\nI really like this movie. This is what a lot of people would call a \"chick flick\", but it's a movie that guys can get into as well. Billy Crystal plays the male lead and is great in the role. He is funny, as always, and this was the first movie I had seen him in. And what can you say about Meg Ryan that hasn't been said already? Wow. Everybody loves Meg Ryan. Guys think she is beautiful and retains that 'girl next door' quality at the same time. Women just love her movies, think she's a great actress, and find her 'cute'. This was the first of her many romantic roles that would go on to define her career. I honestly couldn't think of a better actress to play this role and she does it flawlessly.\n\nCarrie Fisher & Bruno Kirby play key supporting roles here. Fisher is particularly good as Meg Ryan's best friend. Rob Reiner does another great job directing here and was really on a roll by the time this movie came out. Nora Ephron, who would later go on to direct her own 'chick flicks', wrote a great script that was basically based off of a lot of real life influences (including Reiner's divorce).\n\nSimply put, this is a great movie to sit and watch with your girlfriend. It's one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan have great chemistry and really own this movie. It's a very funny movie and it goes to show just how different men & women really are.\n\nSpecial Features: There is a 35 min. documentary on the making of the movie. The movie was released in 1989, so having a documentary looking back at the movie was great. Rob Reiner, Nora Ephron, & Billy Crystal do most of the talking here. Carrie Fisher has some moments. Meg Ryan doesn't appear except for old footage from '88. Overall it's a pretty good documentary and surprisingly informative.\n\nThere are also seven deleted scenes included. They are all pretty good and could have been included in the movie. You also get a music video by Harry Connick Jr. (he did the music for the movie), trailer, and an audio commentary from Rob Reiner.
