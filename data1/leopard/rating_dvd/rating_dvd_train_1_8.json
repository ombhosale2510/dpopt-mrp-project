And he grows throughout the film, from a battered youth into a hyper-disciplined athlete, and then as an inmate seeking deeper meaning in life.  It is truly amazing how well he pulls this off.\n\nThen there is the youth who contacts him, a boy from a similar background who is given a chance by a remarkable and unorthodox household.  For some reason, the Hurricane responds to him after ignoring many others, and these two - as well as his foster parents - embark on their own journey of discovery.  As the youth matures, he learns about the political system and feels empowered to change things. That is a profoundly healthy of the American political system.  Eventually, they do change things, which is also a big step of trust and engagement for the Hurricane.  It is really beautiful and uplifting, deeply moving as I identified with both characters.\n\nI now want to learn about the protagonists, perhaps in biographies.  The story goes to the heart of an America in transition, when I grew up.  I do not know enough to answer the critiques about his character by other reviewers.\n\nWhile I think that more details should have been included in the film, the drama is taut and well told in my view.
