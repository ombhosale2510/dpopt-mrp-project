First off, the movie is almost three hours long (172 minutes) and if you're going to have a movie that long...It better be damned good. Well, overall, Heat has it's ups and downs (and scenes that could've been edited out); But it's a pretty good film. Pacino plays Vincent Hanna, an LAPD cop who's detached from his wife and stepdaughter (Natalie Portman) because he spends all his time tracking down criminals. On the flipside of the coin is Neil McCauley (De Niro), who distances himself from relationships in order to continue on his life of crime. Neil runs crime oufits and orchestrates heists and he's pretty good too. Val Kilmer ('The Doors') plays Chris Shiherlis, Neil's friend and semi-partner. The movie is kind of your typical cop and robber thriller. There are some differences and stuff I haven't seen in the typical film. Scenes like when Vincent has coffee with Neil, when he knows Neil is planning a bank robbery is cool. The movie's cast is huge and features big names. Some of them include, Jon Voight ('Midnight Cowboy'), Tom Sizemore ('Natural Born Killers'), Amy Brenneman ('Judging Amy'), Ashley Judd ('Double Jeopardy'), Mykelti Williamson ('Lucky Number Slevin'), Jeremy Piven ('Entourage'), Ted Levine ('The Hills Have Eyes'), William Fichtner ('Prison Break'), Hank Azaria ('Along Came Polly'), Danny Trejo ('Spy Kids' who's playing a role that was clearly written for him. The character is named Trejo), Tone Loc (the rapper), Henry Rollins (the Black Flag frontman), and more. The biggest flaw I saw in the movie was the fact that it digs too much into Vincent and Neil's personal lives. Most heist movies present the cop and the robber, rather than explain them. In that aspect, it was cool of Michael Mann to try something different and mix it up a little bit. Problem is, I was more interested in what Neil's plans were and what Vincent was going to do about it than I was about intimacy/relationship issues. The movie has its moments of high energy action and then it's moments of dullness. But it's a good film and every moment Pacino and De Niro are onscreen together, it's electrifying.\n\nGRADE: B", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Michael Mann ( director of Collateral & Miami Vice ) wrote and directed this film , which stars two of the most legendary actors in the world . . .

In \"Tortilla Soup\" he takes the leading role in a Mexican-American remake of Ang Lee's \"Eat Drink Man Woman\".   \n\nHe plays Martin Naranjo, a Mexican Chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist.  The movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared, then eaten, that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen.  Martin is has lost much of his sense of taste, which he thinks is a cruel irony, but his Cuban partner reminds him that Beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing.  Martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago.  Elizabeth Pena is Leticia, the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple \"grace\" into mini-sermons.  Jacqueline Obradors is the saucy Carmen, who was encouraged to get her MBA by Martin, but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion - as her father did with his wondrous cooking.  Tamara Mello is the youngest Maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to \"find herself\".  Constance Marie is family friend Yolando, who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who Martin dotes on.  Raquel Welch is Yolando's mother, Hortensia, who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished Martin.   \n\nThe film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions.  At the beginning of the film all of the characters are single.  By the end they've all been paired off in one manner or another, some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others.  Raquel Welch is a bit of a distraction in the film.  At age 61 she has a show-stopping beauty that few woman would aspire to at age 25.  In a film full of attractive performers she doesn't \"look her age\" enough to blend into the story.  She plays the part of geriatric bombshell jester and in a nice ensemble this role sticks out like a geriatric bombshell jester. \n\nThe movie otherwise has some realistic and positive things to say about aspirations and relationships and I would recommend it if only to watch Hector Elizondo around the dinner table and in the kitchen.", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] Hector Elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill .

Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to \"purify\" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is \"preserve the Aryan race.\"  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.\n\nYes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single \"good\" thing about this movie would have been \"discovered/invented\" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.  \n\nThey say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a \"hero\" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.  \n\nIn conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the \"techniques\" that this film claims to have \"discovered\" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.
