This film felt like a \"blind date\" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.\n\nWhat initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the clich use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.\n\nSpeaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' \"Looking at America\" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.\n\nOverall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just \"played it safe\".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!\n\nGrade: ** out of ****", "label": "2", "processed_sent": "[CLS] With The Straight Story , Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love .

These old folk and fairy tales, mined from countries such as Germany and Russia and compiled in 2 discs here, along with the Greek tales, are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers: John Hurt for the European fables and Michael Gambon for the Greek re-tellings. But, with much respect to Mr. Gambon, who himself does a fine job, it is John Hurt who decidedly draws my attention. Hurt, with the more eye-catching portrayal, is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \n\nIt doesn't hurt that the stories featuring Hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by Anthony Minghella, who, nearly a decade later, would win an Oscar for directing THE ENGLISH PATIENT. As such, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER gloriously lives up to its titular billing. John Hurt's performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as, propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off-kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make-up, he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories. Minghella's screenplays are replete with rich, witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up. The kids, of course, won't have that frame of reference, but, still, watching these episodes, it really does feel as if you're sitting around the fire, enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns. \n\nMichael Gambon, on the other hand, is burdened with the weightier and grimmer Greek tales. Thus, he eschews John Hurt's light, ebullient touch, opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona. He's pretty good, mind you, but, in the final analysis, he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to John Hurt. Both Hurt and Gambon, by the way, are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog (as operated by Brian Henson). \n\nAt a half hour per episode, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER is presented in a marriage of live acting, creative animatronics, and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery. Jim Henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values, coming up with excellent special effects (for its time), seamless puppetry, matte paintings, and yeoman make-up work, all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting. A charming quirk of the series, which adds a nice touch, is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the Storyteller and his dog. The camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace, but, somewhere in the background, whether it's on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup, images depicting the story are set in motion. Pretty neat. \n\nThe stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid's fable we're used to over here, especially the Greek entries, and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones (\"The Soldier and Death,\" \"The Heartless Giant\"). But don't keep the kids from watching this series; everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories. \n\nIt does help that most of these tales are little known in the States, thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there. When was the last time CINDERELLA or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, timeless as they are, offer up anything new? This is just about as perfect as television shows can get; the only flaw I can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever. ALL the episodes are superb, but if I had to pick the best of the pack, I would definitely go with \"Hans My Hedgehog,\" \"The Soldier and Death\" and \"The Three Ravens.\" With several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION truly is a MUST HAVE dvd set.\n\n**************************************************************************\n\nSPOILERS follow. The nine European fables:\n\n\"Hans My Hedgehog\" - From an early German folk tale: A barren peasant woman, desperately craving a child, naively says aloud that if she had a baby, she wouldn't care what it looks like. Soon enough, she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog, much to the father's dismay and the scorn of the villagers. \n\n\"Fearnot\" - From an early German folk tale: A carefree, absent-minded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear. Though still very good, this may be the weakest episode of the lot. Gabrielle Anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role.\n\n\"A Story Short\" - From an early Celtic folk tale: The Storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and, as punishment meted out by the king, must tell one story a day for a year. All goes well until the very last day when the Storyteller suffers from storyteller's block. Brenda Blethyn has a part.\n\n\"The Luck Child\" - From an early Russian folk tale: Seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current king, the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him. But those blessed with luck cannot be undone...and the same could be said for prophecies. \n\nThe Soldier & Death\" - From an early Russian folk tale, this is an awesome story. Because of kind acts towards three beggars, an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack, a deck of cards, and a nice whistle, which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil Death.\n\n\"The True Bride\" - From an early German folk tale. Shades of Aslan! A white lion comes to the aid of a girl (Jane Horrocks, LITTLE VOICE) being held under the cruel care of a troll. Co-starring Sean Bean.\n\n\"The Three Ravens\" - From an early German folk tale: A wicked witch (Miranda Richardson) weds a widowed king (Jonathan Pryce) and then, recognizing that the king's three sons and daughter pose a threat to her ambition, transforms the three sons into ravens. But the princess (Joely Richardson) escapes and is told by her brothers that, unless she remains speechless for three years, three months, and three days, they'll be trapped in their raven forms forever.\n\n\"Sapsorrow\" - From an early German folk tale: This is a variant on Cinderella (or is it the other way around?) as a beautiful princess (the unimpressive Alison Doody), seeking to escape an arranged marriage, flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag. But, then, she falls in love with the prince...Co-starring Jennifer Saunders.\n\n\"The Heartless Giant\" - From an early German folk tale: On the whole, giants are benign creatures, harmless to none, unless, of course, the giant hasn't a heart. This story is about a curious prince who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the king's dungeon...\n\nThe Greek myths: \n\n\"Daedalus and Icarus\" - The inventor Daedalus and his son Icarus flee from the wicked King Minos with the aid of Daedalus's man-made wings, but will Icarus heed his father's advice? I'm guessing, not.\n\n\"Orpheus and Eurydice\" - The musician Orpheus descends to Hades to bring back his dead wife.\n\n\"Perseus and the Gorgon\" - The hero Perseus faces the Gorgon, Medusa.\n\n\"Theseus and the Minotaur\" - It's Theseus, with some help from a beautiful princess, versus the savage Minotaur, half-man, half-bull.", "label": "5", "processed_sent": "[CLS] In 1987 and 1988 , JIM HENSON ' S THE STORYTELLER aired and became an instant showpiece for television , a truimphant ( but short - lived ) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser - known northern European fairy tales and , later , into four timeless stories drawn from Greek mythology .

Her acting debut \"I'll Be There\" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so.\n\nSeventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl.\n\nThe problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because \"I'll Be There\" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting.\n\nWith a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills. \n\nThe best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church.\n\nMiss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. \"I'll Be There,\" but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can", "label": "2", "processed_sent": "[CLS] There ' s a reason why they talk about the \" Voice of an Angel \" - - it ' s because Charlotte Church certainly doesn ' t have the acting presence of one .

The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round. \n\nThe story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but \"Lemony Snicket...\" entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!). \n\nThere's a lot of CGI here but not to the point to annoy you, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performance to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles.

Fisher is particularly good as Meg Ryan's best friend. Rob Reiner does another great job directing here and was really on a roll by the time this movie came out.

Too many `entertainment' movies lately are trying to be something more and in the process end up being substantially less. I have no problem with experimentation within a genre, but when so much of that experimentation fails it becomes the films that stick to the basics and do them justice that become rewarding. \"Four Brothers\" is just such a film. It is not perfect by any means, and at times falls hopelessly into the traps I have mentioned, but when it sticks to what it does best it works better than any action films I have seen in a while. John Singleton finds a pace and a tone that drives and heightens the story and characters and in doing so helps a film that could have been so drearily standard become something substantially more. Rather than mere dull formula or misguided wandering, the film achieves a level of lively entertainment, something which Hollywood as of late has been having trouble delivering. \n\nSo what makes \"Four Brothers\" different? First of all the story is simple enough that it more often then not does bog down the pace of the film. This is not always true and there is certainly a mid-film lull when various uninteresting plot twists and revelations hold back the good old-fashioned a@# kickings, but for the majority of the movie the plot is used to progress, rather than hold back the action. Plus, nothing works better for an unapologetically violent and exuberant action movie than a story of vengeance, and \"Four Brothers\" is best when not trying to make any claims to the contrary. The acting suits the film also, especially Mark Wahlberg, who I often enjoy and who here is obviously enjoying himself, playing a character boisterous and aggressive enough to suit Wahlberg's mischievous grin and tough-guy looks. Terrence Howard is as icy cool as always playing a cop from the streets, and barring the overwrought performance Chiwetel Ejiofor as Victor Sweet, the mobbed-up head baddy, all the actors fit their roles well. Ejiofor is certainly meant to be over-the-top, but just as all the scenes that feature him, he just doesn't quite fit with the more street-level tone of the rest of the film.\n\nSingleton often looks as though he is still trying to direct music videos, which is an approach that often works, and often does not. The opening scenes of \"Four Brothers\" are great, as Singelton aptly sets the tone for the action to follow. Scenes of snow-covered Detroit and brotherly bonding are played to the songs of Marvin Gaye and Motown and set a real slick tone to the film that works well. There are stumbles, such as the heavy-handed Thanksgiving dinner scene, but for the most part these sequences are succinct enough to establish a genuine interest in the character and, therefore, a vest interest in the story to follow. As the film picks up so does the pace, sometimes thrillingly, as with the basketball game or the various action sequences, sometime disappointingly, as with the film's insistence on an ill-fated blacksploitation sub-plot, but in a way which is never boring. This is ultimately the true success of the film. It may be a reflection on the current state of Hollywood movies, but \"Four Brothers\", for all its faults and misguided straying, is a particularly successful movie because it at least never fails to entertain. \n\nI fear I have praised the film too much here. Don't get me wrong, I certainly rolled my eyes once or twice while watching (especially at the very last scene) and was disappointed by more than a few aspects of the film, but the parts that I was critical of disappointed mainly because the parts that did work worked so well. Wahlberg was one reason, Singleton's astute eye for slick entertainment was another, but the main reason the film worked was because it was content to be what is was: an unabashedly shallow, lively, and entertaining action film.", "label": "4", "processed_sent": "[CLS] \" Four Brothers \" is successful as an action film because it accepts its role as an action film .
